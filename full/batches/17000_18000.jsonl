The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Navy strike aircraft in hostile campaigns around the world. The aircraft and weapons available for each campaign are historically accurate.A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target. Priority is placed on speed and realism. You get to resolve every missile launched at enemy bandits, and every air to ground attack against the enemy target. You also get to resolve the enemy SAM, AAA, and Bandit attacks against your aircraft. While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Bandits, SAMs, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices. The more suppression munitions you haul to the target, the safer your pilots will be, but you will be able to load fewer munitions to destroy the target.We've included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!\"] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"9 x 3 x 12 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"3.6 pounds\", \"Manufacturer recommended age\": \"14 years and up\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Department\": \"unisex-adult\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Dan Verssen Games\", \"Age Range (Description)\": \"Adult\", \"Brand\": \"Dan Verssen Games\", \"Theme\": \"Action\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"9 x 3 x 12 inches\", \"Item Package Quantity\": \"1\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Each year Visconti adds a new model inspired to the most famous paintings of Van Gogh.

The SP 70-200mm F/2.8 Di VC USD G2 Lens was developed by substantially enhancing the features of its predecessor. These include a thorough review of the optical, mechanical and electronic designs to increase autofocus speed and precision, reinforce VC (Vibration Compensation) functions and to shorten the MOD. New features include eBAND Coating, Moisture-Proof and Dust-Resistant Construction, Fluorine Coating and compatibility with teleconverters. The lens design features a metal-based barrel for improved handling and ease-of-use. The result of this dramatic evolution is SP 70-200mm F/2.8 Di VC USD G2 Lens, a high-speed telephoto lens that widens the scope of expression for photography in a broad range of genres, such as portraits, landscapes, sports and photojournalism.:Outstanding resolution and contrast reproduction performance, beautiful bokeh and full compatibility with Tamron teleconverters - Based on the current model (A009), the optical design has been revised and improved. Both the resolution and contrast reproduction performance far exceed the present levels. Bokeh has been enhanced and expanded to deliver outstanding background effects across the entire zoom range. Use of a circular diaphragm with nine blades further improves bokeh. The optical design of the new A025 consists of 23 elements in 17 groups. Optimum deployment of XLD (eXtra Low Dispersion) and LD (Low Dispersion) glass elements thoroughly eliminate chromatic aberrations, which tend to become particularly prominent in high-speed telephoto lenses, across the entire zoom range, while ensuring uniform, high-level image quality even on the periphery of the image plane.Improved VC system provides highest Vibration Compensation ability in its class3 (5 stops using CIPA standard compliant) and offers three situation-specific VC modes - Utilizing Tamron's original VC\"] ['VC performance is 5 stops (VC mode 3) and offers three modes optimized for different shooting situations', 'MOD reduced to 37.4\" (1:6.1 max. mag.

When the pressure on the holder increases, the bars are automatically pressed toward the wood. The lateral pressure increases in proportion to the thickness of the wood. The bars center the wood exactly, which makes the glued laths perfectly even. By dividing the pressure equally over the glued surfaces, the risk of gaps in the joints is totally eliminated. And, because pressure is adjusted by handwheels, it won't be long until you get the feel of how to find the correct pressure for each thickness of joint and every type of wood.

Forward or reverse delay can be shifted once or have continuously shifted repeats. It delivers a wide range of sounds including modulated and harmonized delays, reverse delays, chorus, arpeggios, infinite descents, chaotic self-oscillation, and continuously evolving soundscapes. The core of the Raster\u2122 is a clean delay with up to 1600 milliseconds of delay time. Three delay ranges allow you to precisely dial in resonant feedback sounds and instantly change delay time with rhythmic shifts. The feedback control has infinite repeats at 3 o\u2019clock and chaotic, textured feedback loops at higher levels. Knob responses are carefully tuned for exploration of self-oscillation and feedback on the verge of blowing up. A tone control sweeps from dark analog-style repeats to digital clarity and emphasizes the attack at higher settings. The left and right delay times can be set as a ratio, so a single knob changes both in sync, or offset by milliseconds for movement and widening (Haas Effect). The two delay channels can be arranged in series, parallel or ping pong. Pitch shifting repeats up or down in semitone steps creates tempo-synced arpeggios and alien organ sounds. The detune setting can dial in micro pitch shifts and chorused repeats. The left and right channels can be shifted by the same amount, a ratio, or opposite directions. At subtle settings, repeats evolve in a way that sounds natural, but different from analog delays. Beyond pitch shifting, a combination phase/frequency shifter creates subtle evolving repeats, dissonant harmonies, and barber pole flanging. It can be pushed to extremes for ring modulation and inharmonic shifted delays that distort and break apart. The Raster\u2019s modulation section has seven waveforms that can be assigned to delay time, pitch shift, or effect level (for tremolo). There are two random waveforms for glitchy pitch jumps, wow and flutter, and broken tape deck effects. Envelope and inverse envelope enable dynamic flanging and pitch bent delays. Stereo controls adjust the modulation amount and phase between channels, for subtle shifts or swirling psychedelic washes. Capable of extreme sonic mayhem, the Raster can also be used with restraint to add unique character to your sound. The Raster 2 is performance friendly, with 6 knobs and 9 switches. The original Raster was praised for its knob response and immediacy, and the Raster 2 maintains that simplicity while adding flexible modulation and extensive stereo functionality.

Radio-friendly tools include a telephone communication (telco) channel, mic channel ON switch sensing, stereo channel start/cue outputs for CD deck transport control and automatic muting of speaker outputs. A separate monitor mix can be created for operator and guest or presenter, and the operator can speak off-air to the studio or telephone callers using the 'Talk' feature. XB-10's preamps use low noise discrete transistor circuitry to achieve high gain and excellent linearity. Each mic channel comes equipped with our innovative CompACT compressor to keep the dynamic range of a presenter microphone under control. A variable limiter on the main output ensures that the final mix to air does not saturate expensive broadcast equipment. The plug-n-play USB connection can be used for VoIP telephone calls, recording program material, playing jingles and more. The XB-10 comes with a full duplex USB soundcard built-in and many useful routing options for recording and broadcast applications. It features a responsive 3-band, swept mid frequency EQ design which utilizes MusiQ with optimized slope for a variety of sources. A variable limiter ensures the level does not exceed a pre-defined level. Back panel option switches allow the limiter to be bypassed. A trim pot is used to vary the threshold and an LED on the front panel indicates when the limiter has triggered. The XB-10 features our ComPACT compressor, which combines both downward and upward compression with peak limiting.

That\\'s why these models are among the first radiators to really earn the descriptor \"full copper\"! All the main elements, not just the fins and channels, but also the channel heads are made of copper. Material-wise, this is a big advantage, and one where other radiators fall by the wayside. The Alphacool NexXxoS X-Flow radiators set themselves apart significantly from conventional radiators in their construction. The X-Flow radiators are built for high flow rates. The slanted copper chambers on either side are built identically. This means the water can flow through all the channels at the same time until it flows into the opposite chamber and leaves the radiator. Freedom in the installation is one of the central points on which Alphacool\\'s development department focused. Fewer angles are needed, which increases the flow rate and offers more options in the installation. The installation of the radiators, as well as the fans and radiator faceplates, is easy to do with this series: the M3 threads are standard in the radiator sector, affordable and available in all lengths. Even the dreaded mishap of turning the screws in too deeply won\\'t lead to costly damage with this radiator: an inner protective edge stops the screw before it can come into contact with the fins. The fin spacing was chosen so that the radiator could reach its optimal cooling performance even with slow or medium-speed fans. This is not only comfortable in terms of background noise, but also puts no constraints on the choice of fans.

It is more dimensionally stable than Nylon and used in many industrial ball bearing and friction reducing applications. Compared to Delrin, it is softer but tougher. Delrin is harder but more brittle. It is an ideal material for frame sliders since it can absorb more impact force onto itself and therefore reduce the impact on the frame and engine.

Kotobukiya' s hit Marvel Comics ARTFX+ series has brought fans Avengers straight out of the comics, and now it turns to the big screen with the upcoming mega-blockbuster Avengers: Age of Ultron. Two mighty characters start the new collection headlined by the massive IRON MAN! A fan-favorite design from the comics that's coming in the Avengers sequel, the Hulk buster is a specially-designed upgrade to the Iron Man armor created by Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark to combat the Hulk if he should go berserk. Classified as the Iron Man Mark 44 armor, the Hulk buster suit really tears it up! Based on its appearance in the film, the huge armor looks as if it leapt straight off the screen. Iron Man strides forward to grapple with the green-skinned Avenger, leg pistons cranking and his right arm stretching out to make contact. While the resemblance to the classic Iron Man armor is readily apparent (especially in the bright metallic red and gold color scheme), the Hulk buster takes it to a whole new level with a towering frame, thick armor plating, and a stout shape. Best of all, that huge shape means a ton of surface area for amazing sculpting featuring all of the technological details of the Iron Man suit including surface armor, interior electronics, layered components, repulsor units, integrated weaponry, and much more! Sculpted by the same master artist who's responsible for the Avengers Marvel Now series, Junnosuke Abe (), Hulk buster Iron Man stands an incredible 11 1/2 inches tall (in the ARTFX+ 1/10th scale) to tower over his allies and enemies alike. Stark's latest and greatest battle suit lumbers across a brick-like display base, punishing the ground with its terrible weight. The Hulk buster is one of the most impressive display pieces you'll ever own and it even pairs with the new Avengers: Age of Ultron Hulk ARTFX+ statue to make a fierce battle scene!\"] ['A Kotobukiya import', \"Based on Iron Man's massive Hulk buster armor in Avengers: Age of Ultron\", 'Sculpted in 1:10 scale', 'Special display base', 'Designed to display with Avengers Age of Ultron Hulk'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"15 x 12 x 10 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"5 pounds\", \"Manufacturer recommended age\": \"18 months - 15 years\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Release date\": \"September 9, 2015\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Diamond Comic Distributors\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

So we started from scratch, reinventing each essential element as part of a singular, deceptively simple design. It's everything there is to love about Mac. In its purest form ever. A keyboard reimagined from A to Z. From the beginning, our goal was to design a full, uncompromising Mac experience. And a full-size keyboard is an essential part of that. In order to fit a full-size keyboard in the incredibly thin MacBook, we designed the keyboard from the ground up. Each component has been rethought specifically for the new MacBook, from the underlying mechanism to the curvature of the surface of each key to the distinctive new typeface. The result is a keyboard dramatically thinner than its predecessor. Now when your finger strikes the key, it goes down and bounces back with a crisp, consistent motion that makes typing with precision a breeze. Butterfly mechanism. Traditional keyboards use a scissor mechanism, which tends to wobble around the edges. This creates a lack of precision when you strike anywhere except the center of the key. We needed to reduce key wobbling for a keyboard this thin; otherwise, striking a key off-center could result in the keycap hitting bottom before a keystroke registers.

In the Four Thirds system, the lens diameter is larger than the image circle, making it possible to design the lens so that the light passes on a straight path to the image sensor.

Renowned Carl Zeiss contrast and resolution brings out the best in \u03b17 series full frame E-mount bodies. The T* coating works with an innovative optical design to suppress internal reflections, for sublime contrast from highlights to deep blacks. In keeping with the Sonnar concept, a large F1.8 maximum aperture can produce beautiful full-frame background bokeh, but you also have the option of stopping down for extended depth-of-field. A bright lens like this is also an advantage when shooting indoors or outdoors in low light. Linear motor driven internal focusing is smooth and quiet, and a dust and moisture resistant design ensures consistently reliable performance. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh\u2019 effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. \u03b1 lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. Coated optics were pioneered by Carl Zeiss - and this superb lens features the Carl Zeiss T* (T-Star) coating that virtually eliminates lens flare, internal reflection and light scattering that can otherwise occur at glass-to-air surfaces. The T* coating contributes to outstanding image quality, with high contrast and uniformly excellent resolution right out to the image edges.

A single unit occupies a mere 1U of rack space, yet can control up to 16 directly connected computers. Each computer/server can be located up to 100 ft. from the KVM switch using Cat5e/6 cabling, with support for video resolutions up to 1920 x 1080 at 60Hz. A full-screen graphical OSD with multi-level authentication (Administrator and User) allows you to quickly and efficiently manage your installation. Allows for remote authentication via RADIUS and LDAP/S, and supports both IPv4 and IPv6. The OSD includes a range of settings for system configuration that allow you to add accounts, customize account access, install a SSL certificate, backup and restore system settings, upgrade firmware, and more. Accessing the connected computers is a breeze; a wide range of video and mouse sync settings ensure optimal remote session performance in any situation. In addition to ports for computers/servers, two serial ports are provided for the connection and control of serial manageable devices such as PDU's, firewalls, and routers. IP PDU's can be added as devices to be controlled by the KVM, and individual KVM ports can be assigned to a PDU port, giving you the ability to Power Cycle or Power Off/On the computer/server connected to that port.

This allows photographers to set exposure at the widest aperture and zoom all the way through to 200mm without having to decrease shutter speed. Developed for use with a Canon SLR camera, this autofocus telephoto zoom lens offers optimized use with the Canon EOS series digital cameras. Of particular note, Canon has introduced an image stabilizer (IS) that adjusts to meet the demands of professional photography. IS reduces dramatically the image blur caused by camera shake. Gyro sensors detect unwanted vibrations, triggering the corresponding movement of a correcting lens group perpendicular to the optical axis. This alters the light path, returning the image to its correct position on the sensor or film plane. For shooting immobile subjects, Mode 1 corrects for movement in the image along both the horizontal and vertical axes. For shooting while panning horizontally to follow a moving subject, Mode 2 turns off vertical correction and prevents the effect of dragging the subject back through the frame. The lens' Ring-type USM employs ultra-sonic frequency vibrations to drive auto focus with unrivalled speed and near-silent operation. A powerful CPU and improved AF algorithm contribute to speed performance. The EF 70-200mm f/4L IS USM includes distance metering information, providing compatibility with the E-TTL II flash system of late model cameras such as the EOS-1D Mark II, EOS-1Ds Mark II, EOS 5D and EOS 400D.
