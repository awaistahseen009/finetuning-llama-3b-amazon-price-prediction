The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-180x. The binocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The WH10x20mm and WH20x10mm super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces combine with the 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective to provide continuous zoom magnification and a longer working distance for inspecting large-scale specimens that require handling or repair. High-eyepoint eyepieces ease viewing for users who wear glasses, and dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. The microscope includes 0.5x and 2.0x Barlow lenses that can be added to the objective to increase the magnification range. A Barlow lens with a magnification of less than 1.0 reduces magnification and increases the working distance, while a Barlow lens with a magnification greater than 1.0 increases the magnification and reduces the working distance.

It is powerful and warm sounding simultaneously with an added core and thickness to the sound. The sound is just downright sexy!

Indeed this was our intention, as the DURGA has become a classic in the saxophone world and we didn\u2019t want to change the base sound signature. We just refined it by adding a fullness/core to the sound. The secret to the DURGA 5 comes from Theo\u2019s latest research and development, which has centered around updating the unique DURGA baffle with a very special chamber called the Medium-Stadium-Chamber. This new chamber is completely new, and works with the physics principle of \u2018boundary layer effect\u2019 much like a golf ball\u2019s dimples. This allows the mouthpiece to get all the benefits of our True Large Chamber AND the extra core of a smaller chamber at the same time. No other mouthpiece in history has been designed like this; it will blow you away since it can both scream and play a soft ballad. It is so much fun to play! Its huge sound makes everything before it sound thin and/or stuffy by comparison. SOUND Great for Jazz, R&B, and Rock & Roll. Projects a sensual tone that is flirtatious and erotic. It makes everyone want to dance! It is so unique; it really has to be played to be understood and believed DESIGN Radical proprietary Medium-Stadium-Chamber.

The all-new X-S1, made in Japan, is the latest addition to the premium X-series that includes the X100 and X10. The X-S1 features a large 2/3\u201d 12 megapixel EXR CMOS sensor and a newly-developed, bright all glass and high-definition F2.8 Wide-Angle to F5.6 telephoto lens with an ultra-smooth 26x manual zoom (24-624mm).

Its intelligently engineered and versatile design integrates easily into high-end whole house audio systems. Efficient Class D design delivers superior audiophile sound quality and performance. The MA1260 can be stacked with other audio components and includes removable ears for mounting in standard audio racks (2RU). Two common or BUS inputs feed audio signals from standard line-level audio sources to any or all channels. Each of the twelve channels has its own dedicated input and independent level adjustment to provide further flexibility. By simply flipping a single switch, two channels can be bridged to increase the total power output for that zone. This is helpful when extra power is needed in certain areas. Manual, automatic on/off, or triggered 12V input turn-on modes facilitate easy integration into automated systems. For quick and easy troubleshooting of the system, each pair of channels or zones has a bi-color LED to indicate its operational status.

After gaining much success as a vocal mic, Avantone decided it's time to expand its coverage in the studio and on stage! Avantone is excited to announce that they have teamed up with Black Lion Audio to offer exactly that! Please welcome the CV-12BLA! With a flatter response and more headroom than before, the CV-12BLA takes what you love about the CV-12 even further! Throw it on drums or piano, close mic a guitar, or throw it on vocals for a finish so polished it'll put more expensive mics to shame!About the CV-12BLABlack Lion Audio has spent over a decade perfecting the art of modding gear. Employing this expertise, Avantone has partnered with them to develop the CV-12BLA. First and foremost, the circuit has been modified to have a flatter response. The high-mid bump that the CV12 is known for was tamed and a different capsule was used to further smooth the highs and bring out the lows resulting in more balance. This flatter response, coupled with higher headroom allows the microphone to be more of a utilitarian microphone that sounds great on just about everything. Avantone particularly found that full range sources are where the CV-12BLA really shined as the frequency range is balanced across the board. The coupling capacitor is an industry favorite Solen FastCap, which was chosen for its transparency. The 32 mm K67 capsule was replaced with a 34 mm CK12 styled capsule which was chosen to compliment the circuit. Leaving no stone unturned, the CV-12BLA features a completely redesigned power supply, featuring a low-noise circuit.Features:Uses Include: Studio vocals, acoustic guitar, mandolin, drum overheads, room mic, pianoA capsule was used to further smooth the highs and bring out the lows for more balance32 mm K67 capsule replaced with a 34 mm CK12 styled capsuleThe frequency range is more balanced across the boardThe coupling cap\"] ['Uses Include: Studio vocals, acoustic guitar, mandolin, drum overheads, room mic, piano', 'A capsule was used to further smooth the highs and bring out the lows for more balance', '32 mm K67 capsule replaced with a 34 mm CK12 styled capsule', 'Modified circuit results in a flatter response', \"Includes deluxe faux alligator case, jetsun shockmount, elegant padded genuine wooden mic box, low-noise circuit power supply, and owner's manual\"] {\"Item Weight\": \"12 Pounds\", \"Date First Available\": \"May 16, 2019\", \"Material Type\": \"Stone\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Brand\": \"Avantone\", \"Connectivity Technology\": \"XLR\", \"Included Components\": \"Microphone\", \"Polar Pattern\": \"Unidirectional\", \"Material\": \"Stone\", \"Number of Channels\": \"1\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The Iron Cobra Rolling Glide is a twin kick pedal for the serious player. The pedal's solid foundation can be attributed to its Super Stabilzer design that incorporates a wider base plate and frame for absolute stability. At each pedals heel, the specially designed 3-piece Hinge Guard Block provides a more durable hinge point and also lengthens the footboard for increased leverage. At the heart of the Iron Cobra is the Rolling Glide cam, which has been upgraded to the lighter, smoother, more natural feeling LiteSprocket design. This cam is an offset double-chained Rolling Glide cam, which delivers an evenly paced stroke from start to finish as it travels towards the bass drum head. The Speedo-Ring rocker cam is yet another example of streamlining, eliminating spring friction with a high-quality, built-in ball bearing rocker. The Quick-Hook spring attachment eliminates wobbling, provides maximum power transmission to the Speedo-Ring, and helps facilitate quicker setup. To further improve speed and beater stroke action, the adjustable Cobra Coil spring return constantly works to push the footboard back to its original position, tightening the relationship between players foot and the pedal. Perhaps one of the most ingenious developments of the is its Swivel Spring Tight tension locking mechanism, which are designed to rock or swivel, allowing freer spring movement and a smoother overall feel.

Originally devised 85 years ago to personify the British company's focus on value and quality, the bookshelf design went on to becoming one of the most popular speakers in audio history and ultimately spawned a series of successive models based on its engineering, appearance, and aural traits. The legendary pedigree again bursts to life with the Denton 85th Anniversary Edition, a two-way bookshelf loudspeaker featuring a 6.5-inch woven Kevlar cone bass driver and one-inch soft-dome treble. Mounted on a rigid diecast chassis, the former produces rich, crisp, extraordinarily detailed midrange responsiveness marked by grand dynamics and tautly focused lows. Trust us when we tell you that you'll feel the punch and follow the bass lines. And each speaker's woven textile tweeter includes a high-flux ferrite magnet that accounts for smooth high-frequency performance and Wharfedale's signature warmth. A cutting-edge crossover results in ultra-coherent, seamless sonics that will spoil you with involving naturalism, presence, imaging, and fullness. Denton 85th Anniversary Edition expands on the beloved original by also boasting an openness normally unassociated with speakers of this size or price. Intended to provide high-end sonics without any hassle, these bass-reflex speakers will blow you away with how big they sound and how deep their soundstages reach. And tube lovers will find plenty to rave about. Denton 85th Anniversary Edition sings when paired with valve gear. We'd also be remiss if we didn't mention how gorgeous these speakers look.

If you want to play flugelhorn but can\\'t justify paying top dollar for a brand-name instrument our Doubler\\'s flugelhorn was created with your needs in mind. This is a great option if you need a flugelhorn for playing in a big band section or want to broaden your palette as a jazz soloist. It\\'s also a great option for a comeback player, hobbyist, or student! This flugelhorn has a 6 inch copper bell and a classic flugelhorn bore (.413\"). It uses the large shank taper. The horn has a third-valve trigger for improved intonation. This flugelhorn is designed to make it easy to switch between flugel and your trumpet or cornet. We perform a few custom alterations before we ship it to you, including a precision valve alignment, custom spring adjustment, a new leadpipe, extensive play-testing, and more. We spend at least 2 hours per horn adjusting and play-testing! The result is an incredible flugelhorn for a supremely great price!

Answer: A projector with a short throw lens allows placement closer to the wall \u2013 approximately 4\u20135 feet for a 120\u201d image \u2013 compared to a standard lens. This is beneficial in tighter spaces such as small meeting rooms or classrooms. A shorter throw distance eliminates shadows from objects or people impeding the projected image. Question: Is Short Throw easy to set up? Answer: Yes. Simply place the projector on a flat surface. If the projector is not level, use the vertical keystone function to align the image.

Answer: This means the projector is not resting on a surface that is completely flat and level OR the projection surface is not flat. A Short Throw projector lens is less tolerant of misalignment than standard throw projectors, so projecting from a flat surface will ensure a straighter image.
