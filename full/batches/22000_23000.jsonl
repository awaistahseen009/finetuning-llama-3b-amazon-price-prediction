P3700 brings extreme data throughput directly to Xeon processors with up to six times faster data transfer speed than 6 Gbps SAS/SATA SSDs1. The performance of a single drive from DC P3700 Series (460K IOPS), can replace the performance of 7 SATA SSDs aggregated through an HBA (~500K IOPS). At 200 IOPS per Hard Disk Drive (HDD), 2,300 15K HDDs would be needed to match the performance of one these drives. Consistently amazing performance provides fast, unwavering data streams directly to Intel Xeon processors making server data transfers efficient. SSD performance consistency provides scalable throughput when multiple SSDs are unified into a single storage volume. The massive storage bandwidth increase feeds Intel Xeon processor systems giving data center servers a performance boost. Servers can now support more users simultaneously, compute on larger data sets, and address high-performance computing at lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Intel led the industry in creation of a new Non-Volatile Memory Express (NV ME) storage interface standard. NV ME is engineered for current and future NV ME technologies, unlike SAS/SATA SSDs. NV ME overcomes SAS/SATA SSD performance limitations by optimizing hardware and software to take full advantage of NVM SSD technology. Intel Xeon processors efficiently transfer data in fewer clock cycles with the NV ME optimized software stack compared to the legacy Advance Host Controller Interface (AHCI) stack, reducing latency and overhead. Direct CPU connection also eliminates Host-Bus-Adapter (HBA) cards, further reducing latency and TCO.

Now recognized as a must-have feature for digital cameras, Mega O.I.S. compensates for the effects of hand-shake, making it possible to capture clear, crisp photos indoors, at night, or when taking macro close-ups -- those situations in which hand-shake is most likely to be a problem. Even Mega O.I.S., however, cannot suppress the motion blur caused by a subject moving as the photo is being snapped. That's where Intelligent ISO Control comes in. In this system, the camera's Venus Engine III image-processing engine detects whether the subject is moving and, as necessary, raises the ISO setting and shutter speed according to how fast the subject is moving and the light conditions. This happens automatically, so you can shoot without the bother of adjusting settings every time conditions change. Lumix and its powerful Intelligent Image Stabilization system do all the work automatically. You enjoy easy, trouble-free shooting in any situation and get the satisfaction that comes with capturing clear, beautiful images.\", 'In addition, the FX10 offers a range of features that enhance usability and add convenience. The new Quick Setting function lets you quickly and easily access and set the functions used most often. With the new Date Stamp function, you can simply stamp the date on photos or you can take advantage of two original Lumix features. When travelling, you can stamp the day of the trip on the photos you take. Or, if you have a baby, you can stamp his or her age in months on your photos. The stamped information appears on photos that you print yourself at home or have printed at a photo shop.', 'It also boasts an internal 27MB memory (approximate) and accepts large-capacity SDHC memory cards, giving users more flexibility in shooting and recording.

Between engines, wind, water, seagulls, radio chatter, and your fun-loving friends, you\\'re lucky to hear anything at all. If your day on the water includes activities like water skiing and wakeboarding, the challenge is multiplied. That said, being on a boat doesn\\'t have to mean tinny, screechy sound from cheap equipment. If you\\'re going to crank it up (and you are), your music might as well sound as good as it can. That\\'s why so many boaters are investing in marine-rated receivers, speakers, subwoofers, and amplifiers. If you\\'re serious about sound, an equalizer is the next logical step.

This equalizer/controller packs a lot of features into a compact half-DIN (1\" tall) chassis. The WS-420 BT actually includes two separate equalizers, so you can control the volume and fine-tune the sound of your tower speakers and cabin speakers independently. You also get independent bass level control, so you can adjust your subwoofer, along with a source selector that chooses between the main source, auxiliary input, or Bluetooth input. If you\\'re towing skiiers or wakeboarders, the talk-back microphone will come in very handy. The mic\\'s volume is separate from the music volume, so you can adjust it to suit your needs when it\\'s time to make an announcement.

The wide, elevated front slide is a safe way to exit this bouncer rather than accidentally bouncing and falling out of the house and onto the ground. Large mesh windows made from rip stop netting won\\'t tear like cheaper mesh and they allow children to be supervised. Zippered flaps allow the bouncer to quickly be deflated and taken down for storage. Always use GCFI-protected receptacles/circuits and take caution to keep blower and power cords in dry locations.

Over the past four-plus decades there\u2019s a resounding theme from Taylor Guitars: passion for improving the guitar-playing experience. As a company that\u2019s passionate about exposing more players to the pleasures of making music, Taylor isn\u2019t content to see people throw in the towel before they have a chance to get their groove on. The Academy Series, which includes the Academy 10e Dreadnought Acoustic-Electric Guitar, represents Taylor\u2019s effort to support the development of the entry-level guitar player.

To do so, the playing experience was Taylor\u2019s priority: Easy to hold and play: the body is comfortable and lightweight. The guitar is easy to strum and fret. Rewarding sound: this guitar yields a good sound easily in the hands of a newer player. Not too precious. Durable. Minimal. A guitar that\u2019s too precious can be intimidating for a novice to play and care for. Broad appeal: it covers a broad range of music preferences.

This model features a zoom-lock to maintain consistent magnification when needed, and uses focusable eyepieces rather than integrated dioptric adjusters. With its wide zoom range and double-arm boom-stand, this model will become an indispensable instrument in any workshop or lab. The trinocular photo-port is simul-focal, so it can be used simultaneously with both eyepieces. Ocular Adjustment The ocular tubes are not equipped with dioptric adjusters, so focus is more consistent. Focusable eyepieces are included to compensate for vision irregularities, and are available in various optional magnifications. Rotating interpupillary adjusters simplify the process of aligning the eyepieces for each user. Simul-focal Trinocular Port The simul-focal optics in this microscope allow the trinocular port to be used simultaneously with both eyepieces. This means a camera can stream live images from the microscope while you continue to work with full stereoscopic vision. This is accomplished by sharing the left objective lens with the left ocular and the photo-port. This microscope uses our CX series trinocular port, so it can be easily replaced with optional C-mount ports to match specific cameras. Double-arm Boom-Stand The multi-pivoting, double-arm stand provides a stable, flexible support system, ideal for hands-on work. Use of a drop-down column allows the head to be positioned at virtually any angle.

The first Sony G Lens created specifically for E-mount cameras is true to its heritage, achieving outstanding resolution and contrast throughout the zoom range thanks to an advanced optical design incorporating two ED glass elements and three aspherical elements. From wide angle to medium telephoto, this power zoom lens covers approximately a 6x zoom range with a constant F4 aperture. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh\u2019 effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. \u03b1 lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.

This game changing amplifier launched many industry firsts, such as first guitar amplifier to have on-board USB, stompbox presets, looper, 5 effect simultaneous operation, and TransTube\u00ae, Peavey\\'s revolutionary analog/digital hybrid technology. In 2012 Peavey raised the bar again with the VYPYR VIP, the world\\'s first Variable Instrument Performance amp. This was the first amplifier designed for use with electric, bass, and acoustic guitar. Additionally, Peavey was the first company to introduce instrument models to an already feature-packed amplifier. Now continuing the tradition of innovation and excellence, Peavey launches the VYPYR X modeling amplifier. This latest evolution of the groundbreaking VYPYR series features updated styling, superior cabinet design for premier acoustic performance, and improved TransTube technology. The new VYPYR X2 also features Bluetooth\u00ae remote control and audio streaming in. Now users can stream backing tracks into the amplifier and control all settings via iOS remote app control. Analog Distortion Each VYPYR\u00ae X is equipped with Peavey\\'s exclusive TransTube\u00ae technology. This true analog distortion not only sounds better, it leaves the amplifier\\'s processing power dedicated to the effects, allowing the VYPYR X to run up to 5 effects simultaneously. When playing live nothing \"cuts through the mix\" like a VYPYR. Many modeling amps simply can\\'t be heard in a live setting because of their poor digital distortion and practice amp EQ. TransTube technology is designed analog to emulate real tubes, and sits perfectly in the mix in a live environment. Variable Instrument Input Thanks to our revolutionary cabinet design and world class processing, users can switch from electric guitar to bass or acoustic on the same amplifier. One amp for all of your performance needs. Instrument Models Make your electric sound like an acoustic or bass guitar, or on the VYPYR X2 up to 10 different instrument models. Bluetooth\u00ae VYPYR\u00ae X Control Control your VYPYR X2 remotely with on-board Bluetooth wireless remote control via Peavey\\'s exclusive VYPYR control app for iOS devices. Now change and store all your favorite presets remotely. Stream audio in, play to your favorite backing tracks, or just sit back and enjoy streaming your favorite music. WYSIWYG Interface Another Peavey original, the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) interface allows users to identify the position of the knobs with a glance at the amp. When a modeling amp changes presets the settings on the knobs change with it; however, on most amps the position of the knob no longer corresponds with the actual setting. This can cause confusion and mistakes that result in random, unwanted outcomes. With the VYPYR, the LEDs around the knob always indicate what position it is in relative to the current preset. Simply a better solution. Amp Accessible Operation Many competitors claim their amps have ['Bluetooth wireless remote control and audio streaming in', '36 on-board amp models including 6 acoustic and 6 bass amp models', '26 total on-board amp accessible effects', '10 instrument models', '16 user assignable presets', '12 amp accessible stompbox effects with dual parameter control', 'iOS app available', 'On-board looper with optional Sanpera footswitch', 'Variable instrument input', '60 Watts RMS'] {\"Item Weight\": \"1 pounds\", \"Package Dimensions\": \"23 x 19 x 14 inches\", \"Date First Available\": \"June 2, 2021\", \"Color Name\": \"Black\", \"Compatible Devices\": \"Guitar\", \"Connector Type\": \"Usb,wireless\", \"Output Wattage\": \"40 Watts\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Brand\": \"Peavey\", \"Color\": \"Black\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"14\\\"D x 19\\\"W x 23\\\"H\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Good holding torque stops the lens with precision and accuracy, the instant it arrives at the correct focus point and without overshoot.

Or put that boiling pot right on the work area. Withstanding temperatures of up to 536 Degree, you can't burn, scorch or mar a II sink. Scratch Resistant - Steak knives. Carving knives, paring knives, pots and pans, you name it, II can handle it. So whether you're slicing, dicing, mincing or chopping, you just can't scratch this sink. Acid Resistant- Slice a lemon. Squeeze a grapefruit. When it comes to citrus, II has no fear. Rock hard granite material creates an acid-resistant surface, so you can enjoy all your favorite foods without damaging the finish. Stain Resistant - No matter what you're drinking, pouring\u2026 or even sometimes spilling, II sinks are designed to defy all types of stains. In fact, the ultra-durable, non-porous material resists everything from black tea to red wine. Cleanability - Easier to care for than any other material - our newest innovation is an advanced surface technology that repels water, provides a permanent protective shield against stains and is extremely hygienic. The proof is in the 7 patents and the independent test results - up to 40-percent greater cleanability than others in the category. II is also cleanable with just the wipe of a sponge against grape juice, acidic foods, tea stains, red wine, even hair dyes. Plus, whether you fun a fork, knife or place a hot pan up to 536 Degree right on its surface - all have no lasting impact.

The trinocular head has a vertical camera mount and a Siedentopf binocular mount with interchangeable pairs of WH10x and WH25x eyepieces, 55 to 75mm Siedentopf interpupillary adjustment, a fixed 30-degree vertical inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and a 360-degree rotation capability to provide a more comprehensive view and enable sharing. Dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. The vertical trinocular port accepts a camera with a 23mm or C-Mount adapter (camera sold separately). The mechanical tube length is 6-5/16\" (160mm). The reverse-mounted revolving nosepiece has 4x, 10x, 40xS, and 100xS (oil) DIN infinity plan achromatic objectives that provide color correction, focus over the entire range of the viewing field, and a longer working distance for improved focus when auxiliary components are utilized. The 40xS objective is spring loaded to prevent slide damage when focusing. The 100xS spring-loaded oil-immersion objective uses oil between the specimen and the objective lens to provide increased resolution over a standard objective. A compound microscope is used for inspection and dissection of specimens when two-dimensional images are desired.', 'The microscope has Brightfield/Darkfield (BF/DF) illumination. Brightfield (BF) illumination allows the specimen to absorb light, resulting in a dark image on a light background, and Darkfield (DF) illumination reflects light off the specimen, resulting in a light image on a dark background. Halogen light source provides bright light in a concentrated path, and a Kohler condenser focuses and centers the light path using two iris diaphragms, providing optimum contrast and resolution. The graduated double-layer mechanical stage, with 1mm stage divisions, locks the slide into place and provides precise slide manipulation along the X- and Y-axis to allow coordinates to be recorded, enabling the viewer to return to a specific location on the slide. A stage stop prevents the stage or specimen from coming into contact with the objectives. The stage is 7.1 x 5.9 inches (180 x 150mm) and a traveling range of 3 x 2 inches (75 x 50mm). Graduated coaxial coarse and fine focus has a focusing range of 1-3/16\" (30mm) and fine-focus divisions of 0.002mm (0.\") that enable measurements to be taken. Focus knob tension control prevents the stage from drifting out of focus.
