The one-piece design is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also offers the benefit of being easier to clean versus a two-piece toilet. By removing the gap between the tank and bowl, we eliminate the hiding place for dirt and debris. An additional benefit of the one-piece toilet is that there is no threat of leaks from bolts or gaskets that can occur in two-piece Toilets. The skirted design of the TOTO legato conceals the trap way, which enhances the elegant look of the toilet and adds an additional level of sophistication. Skirted design Toilets also eliminate the need to reach behind the bowl to clean the nooks and crannies of the exterior trap way. The TOTO legato features toto\u2019s tornado flush, a hole-free rim design with dual-nozzles that creates a centrifugal washing action that assists in rinsing the bowl more efficiently. This version of the TOTO legato includes cefiontect, a layer of exceptionally smooth glaze that prevents particles from adhering to the ceramic. This feature, coupled with tornado flush, assists to reduce the frequency of toilet cleanings, minimizing the usage of water, harsh chemicals, and time required for cleaning. The TOTO legato is designed in toto\u2019s universal height, which allows for a more comfortable seat position across a wide range of users. This version of the legato offers TOTO T40 Washlet+ compatibility for when you are ready to upgrade.

Of course the customer always demands the best in its class. The Alphacool NexXxos radiators have come to compete with and to beat the best in their class and to be the best radiator in all sizes. No more endless choices without a clear class leader, the Alphacool NexXxos is the one tool for all your needs!Alphacool has been the company to introduce new developments and improvements in the radiator and water cooling sector generally many times over the last years. Following this tradition, the new NexXxos radiators are the first to truly deserve the \u201cFull copper\u201d attribute. All main parts, not only the fins and channels, but the chambers are also made from copper. This brings an improvement in performance where other radiators are left without a chance. The material already gives an advantage over the competition and the inner structure is up to par with the competition. Separated chambers give the coolant a clear direction, allowing high flow rates which improve the performance of the whole cooling loop. Flat chambers on the heat exchanger increase mounting flexibility thanks to the reduced overall length.Versatile and easy mounting is one of the main points, on which the research and development department at Alphacool focused. The chamber offers three possibilities for fitting installation on both inlet and outlet (not on the NexXos ST30). Less angled fittings are needed, improving flow rates and offering more mounting possibilities. Hence the radiator can even be installed in tight enclosures, where otherwise internal installation is not a possibility.

Standard Speed with Ethernet Solid 5% Silver Condictors Solid High Density Polyethylene Insulation SOLID 5% SILVER Solid conductors eliminate strand-interaction distortion and reduce jitter. Solid silver-plated conductors are excellent for very high-frequency applications, like HDMI audio and video. These signals, being such a high frequency, travel almost exclusively on the surface of the conductor. As the surface is made of high-purity silver, the performance is very close to that of a solid silver cable, but priced much closer to solid copper cable. This is an incredibly cost effective way of manufacturing very high-quality HDMI cables SOLID HIGH- Any solid material adjacent to a conductor is actually part of an imperfect circuit. Wire insulation and circuit board materials all absorb energy (loss). Some of this energy is stored and then later released as distortion.

What is harmonic tremolo? In short, the signal is split into high pass and low pass filters, then modulated with an LFO that is split 180 degrees. The Night Wire takes the traditional harmonic tremolo a few steps further by allowing the center point of both filters to be adjusted for different tones. The filter frequency has three modes: Manual, LFO and Attack. In Manual mode, the center point can be set to a fixed position with the frequency control. In LFO mode, the filters are continuously swept and the frequency control adjusts the speed. In Attack mode, the filters are dynamically swept according to pick attack and the frequency control acts as a range control, much like a standard envelope filter. The tremolo section has two modes, Manual and Attack. In Manual mode, the speed of the tremolo is governed by where the rate control is set. In Attack mode the speed is controlled by pick attack and the rate controls the sensitivity; the harder you pick, the faster the rate and vice-versa. The tremolo can be subtle and shimmery or full-on throbbing depending on where the depth control is set. With the depth set to zero, the Night Wire will act like a fixed filter, phase shifter or envelope-controlled filter depending on which mode the filter frequency is in. It also features a cut/boost volume control to get your levels just right. Each Night Wire is hand made one at a time in the moonlit village of Akron, Ohio. This device is true bypass and uses relay based \u201csoft touch\u201d switching.

The new series is designed to perfectly match recent high-resolution full-frame DSLR cameras that demand the highest quality optical designs. In order to effectively suppress chromatic aberrations and deliver sharp edge-to-edge images at all apertures, the opera 50mm F1.4 FF optical construction includes 3 lens elements molded from SD (Super-low Dispersion) glass and one aspherical glass element in the rear-focus lens group. The lens incorporates a 9-blade, round-shaped diaphragm for naturally beautiful bokeh. Tokina also incorporates an electric diaphragm specific to the Nikon mount for more accurate and precise aperture control. Fast and quite AF along with superior optical performance at all apertures and focus points makes this lens suitable for a variety of photographic genres and scenes. The newly developed, Tokina ELR (Extremely Low Reflection) Coating was engineered to specifically target the visible light spectrum as it enters and passes through the lens. This drastically reduces the reflection ratio when compared to traditional Tokina lens coatings. This results in dramatically reduced ghosting and flare when shooting in challenging lighting conditions especially when strong light sources are within the image.The lens employs the latest advancements in dust-resistance and weather sealing targeting 8 areas in the lens construction most vulnerable to dust and water penetration. When coupled with a dust and weather sealed DSLR camera, the lens will not let you down even in adverse weather conditions. To ensure fast and accurate AF, the opera 50mm F1.4 FF incorporates a high-speed, ring-shaped ultrasonic motor for near-silent operation. This provides photographers and filmmakers a valuable tool when speed and quiet are critical features to capturing their vision.The BH-726 lens hood included with the opera 50mm F1.4 FF has a special filter window incorporated into the design. When the BH-726c window is removed from the hood the user has access to the filter allowing them to rotate polarizer or other rotation type filter.'] ['Max focal length: 50.0 millimetres', 'Excellent sharpness & resolution across the frame', 'Package Weight: 1.206 kilograms', 'Package Dimensions: 13.0 L x 16.9 H x 13.6 W (centimetres)'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"3.15 x 3.15 x 4.21 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"2.09 pounds\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"October 24, 2018\", \"Manufacturer\": \"TOKINA\", \"Brand\": \"TOKINA\", \"Focal Length Description\": \"50 mm\", \"Lens Type\": \"Standard\", \"Compatible Mountings\": \"Nikon F\", \"Camera Lens Description\": \"9\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

This new 100mm lens can cover full frame sensor and focus from 2:1 magnification to infinity. 100mm is a more popular focal length for macro photographers. However, all of the current 100mm macro lenses in the market can only achieve 1:1 (life-size) or even smaller magnification. Shooting with smaller bugs is usually a challenge for macro photographers. The wider magnification range of the new Laowa Macro allows photographers to capture subjects at any size, making it one of the most versatile macro lens in the market. Despite having the wider range, Venus Optics manage to compress the size of the lens to the minimal and it is similar to other 1:1 macro lens in the market. Laowa 100mm 2:1 Macro lens also features an apochromatic (APO) characteristic that chromatic aberration is invisible. Chromatic aberration (CA) is one of the most challenging topic for optics designer as it can usually ruin a perfect image. Some of the macro lenses in the market controls the chromatic aberration at the \"in-focus\" area really well but the CA is uncontrollable in \"out-of-focus\" rendition. The Laowa 100mm, however, delivers an exceptional performance on chromatic aberration suppression, both at the \"in-focus\" area as well as \"out-of-focus\" area. The subject in the image will not be polluted of any unwanted color fringing. Not only it is an exceptional macro lens, the Laowa 100mm f/2.8 is also a very decent portrait lens when focus to infinity. The 12 elements in 10 groups optics design delivers a crystal sharpness image in both macro and infinity distances. The bright f/2.8 and circular aperture renders softly diffused bokeh and isolates the subject from its background. The lens has an internal focusing structure that will not extend when focus is changed. A multilayer coating has also been applied to reduce lens flare and ghosting for increased contrast. If you are looking to use the lens on Sony FE camera via adapter, make sure an electronics adapter is being used or else your aperture cannot be adjusted.'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"8.5 x 5.3 x 5 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"1.8 pounds\", \"Date First Available\": \"February 21, 2020\", \"Manufacturer\": \"VENUS-LAOWA\", \"Brand\": \"LAOWA\", \"Focal Length Description\": \"100mm\", \"Lens Type\": \"Telephoto, Macro\", \"Compatible Mountings\": \"Canon RF\", \"Camera Lens Description\": \"100 month\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

This robust stand-alone subwoofer has a unique configuration that includes a 12\u201d active woofer and two 12\u201d symmetric built passive woofers. The active subwoofer is self-contained and uses the sub\u2019s amplifier to reproduce sound while the two passive symmetric-built woofers enhance the SPL, all contained within a small enclosure. This delicate balance of internal and external power relieves your main speakers from having to produce low frequency sound, allowing them to focus on mid-range and highs. The result is optimal performance, so you\u2019ll experience movie and music soundtracks with prodigious, and tightly controlled, bass authority.Energy-efficient Amplifier TechnologyThe TreVoce1 12\u201d powered subwoofer incorporates advanced digital amplifier technology that maximizes performance but, unlike other powered subs that run unnervingly hot, the TreVoce is very efficient and generates very little heat. In standby mode, this powerful sub consumes less than 0.5 Watts, making it one of the most energy-efficient subs on the market.Dialed-in PerformanceThe TreVoce12 includes an array of controls to dial in just the right amount of bass for whatever is streaming or playing, whether it\u2019s an action adventure film with friends or listening to some funky slap bass on old vinyls. Equipped with a mounted volume control, low pass crossover, and phase control, this sub allows you to control how the bass integrates with your system and room, and tailors it to your own taste. The TreVoce Series also includes signal sensing, so when auto signal sense is selected, the subwoofer will automatically switch to a power saving stand-by mode. Power will turn on when a signal is detected through the input jacks, saving even more energy.Style and Sonic PurityOur TreVoce12 includes gold-plated inputs for the highest quality sound transfer and maximum sonic purity. The reinforced enclosure is not a typical fake wood grain but a synthetic leather that blends easily into any d\u00e9cor.\"] ['POWER: The TreVoce12 is capable of a 800 Watt power output and fills in the low notes missing from your movies and music and gives you that spine-tingling rumble effect from your home theater system', 'SOUND : With 12-inch woofers, this sub has high sound pressure levels and produces sounds in the lower frequency range.

The Neumann KM 184 Small Diaphram Cardioid Microphone has become the classic high-quality miniature microphone. The pressure gradient transducer used in the KM 184 features very smooth frequency response not only for the 0 axis, but also for lateral (off-axis) sound incidence. In typical usage, there is no coloration of sound over a wide pickup angle. Although the KM 184 has the same capsule as the KM 84, the microphone differs slightly on the 0 frequency response: The KM 184 has a gentle rise at about 9 kHz (which brings out the sizzle in cymbals), a characteristic that was introduced very successfully with the KM 140. The result is a tonal balance that is fresher and livelier when compared to the KM 84 with its flat frequency response in that band. This difference was achieved with just a slight change of the capsule's rear opening, and is not due to resonances. With the same transformerless circuitry as is used in the KM 100 system, the KM 184 has excellent technical specifications. Compared to the KM 84 the dynamic range of the KM 184 increased by 24 dB mainly through the reduction of self-noise level to only 22 dB (CCIR) and an increased sound pressure handling capability of up to 138 dB. The KM 184 mic will operate without any problems, even if the input of following equipment happens to be unbalanced, for example as in some DAT recorders. The output is balanced and phantom (48V) powered. The KM 184 is a good economical alternative choice for users looking for a high-quality miniature microphone. You don't have to give up the electroacoustic features you expect from a Neumann microphone!\", 'From the Manufacturer', 'The \"Series 180\" consists of three compact miniature microphones with patterns that satisfy the demands of all common studio applications.', 'Because of its optimized mechanical construction and conscious omission of modularity, which is unnecessary in many cases, the \"Series 180\" is predestined for economy-minded production and home recording studios.', 'The KM 183 omnidirectional and KM 185 hypercardioid microphones are based on the tremendously successful KM 184 cardioid microphone, which has become a standard within the global studio community in just a very short time. All \"Series 180\" microphones are available with either matte black or nickel finish.', 'They come in a folding box with a windshield and two stand mounts that permit connection to the microphone body, or the XLR-connector.', 'Acoustic features', 'The KM 183 and KM 184 microphones are the successors of the well proven KM 83 and KM 84, which have been used since the seventies worldwide with great success.

It's a new-generation digital interchangeable lens camera that does away with the mirror box and complies with the new Micro Four Thirds System standard. It also features Full-time Live View for compact digital camera shooting ease and iA Intelligent Auto) for beautiful photos with point-and-shoot simplicity. In short, the G1 writes an entirely new chapter in the evolution of the digital interchangeable lens camera.\", 'From the Manufacturer', \"With the G1, Panasonic has developed an entirely new-concept digital camera that takes even greater advantage of the compactness and light weight inherent in the Four Thirds System Standard. By increasing the number of electrical contacts between camera body and lens, Panasonic has also increased camera expandability and maximized the future potential of the G1, including compatibility with future features. In addition, the versatile G1 accepts not only Micro Four Thirds System interchangeable lenses, but also conventional Four Thirds System lenses (when an optional adapter is mounted). This means that users can continue to use Four Thirds lenses they already own. The G1 is the world's first camera to employ the new Micro Four Thirds System standard. Together with an innovative mirror-less structure that also dramatically downsizes the camera body, the LUMIX G Micro System achieves a dramatic portability and ease of use by an adoption of electronic Full-time Live View Finder instead of conventional optical viewfinder. Despite the G1's ultra-compact design, it comes fully equipped with features that assure outstanding ease of use, made possible by the contrast AF system. The G1 also boasts iA (Intelligent Auto) mode, a feature that took the world by storm in Lumix digital compact cameras. iA mode brings together a full range of functions - led by AF Tracking , Face Detection, Intelligent ISO Control and Intelligent Exposure - that together let users take strikingly beautiful photos with maximum ease every time they shoot. The G1 breaks new ground in styling too, overturning SLR camera conventions by giving users a variety of body colors to choose from. For people who have been hesitant about moving up to an SLR camera, the G1 is a perfect fit. It is a small, sophisticated, easy-to-use camera that will greatly expand any user's photographic capabilities.\", \"The G1's Live MOS sensor gives users the benefits of Full-time Live View both when viewing the Free-Angle LCD and when looking through the viewfinder. Other new conveniences made possible by the contrast AF include 1-area-focusing, AF Tracking, and a preview functions that show the photographer how changing the shutter speed (and other settings) will affect the photograph.

Our new version uses the same 2.5 micron ribbon as its predecessor, so you can expect the same warm and \u201cfat\u201d sound as before. We redesigned the Fat Head II with both form factor and durability in mind. Its new brass body helps protect the microphone from stray RF noise and is larger than its predecessor for easier handling. Also incorporated into the new model is a reinforced neck and grill assembly along with upgraded plating on its hardware. It now also offers a gold-plated XLR connector. With these changes, the Fat Head II is more at home than ever in both project and professional studios, as well as live on stage. Fat Head II Stereo Pairs include an upgraded basket-style shock mount and the Blumlein stereo bar is now silk screened with mounting indicators. We are now offering the Fat Head II exclusively with a Lundahl LL2913 transformer, which is mounted on a through-hole circuit board. Each microphone is carefully assembled and tested at our headquarters in Olympia, Washington.

This (fire retardant and lead-free) puncture-proof PVC material is approximately 5 times stronger than nylon used in lesser-quality units as it won\\'t tear, fade, get moldy, and it is far easier to clean. Belting reinforcement is used at key stress points, and heavy-duty, multilayer stitching is used throughout. An impressive 30\" tall mattress provides excellent spring force and cushioning that allows for tall leaps and comfortable landings. This bouncer\\'s roof shields children from the sun and features a safety escape hatch that\\'s quick and easy to exit in the event deflation occurs during a power failure. The wide, elevated front slide is a safe way to exit this bouncer rather than accidentally bouncing and falling out of the house and onto the ground. Large mesh windows made from rip stop netting won\\'t tear like cheaper mesh and they allow children to be supervised. Zippered flaps allow the bouncer to quickly be deflated and taken down for storage. An upgraded, 1200 Watt, 1.5 horsepower UL-Listed blower with grounded power cord and covered on/off switch is included (Always use GCFI-protected receptacles/circuits and take caution to keep blower and power cords in dry locations).

One of the best things about the PonyCycle is that not only does it make a wonderful toy, it's also a great form of exercise. When children move on their PonyCycle they train a specific group of muscles, meaning that they grow stronger and healthier while having a great time! Riding on a PonyCycle is completely safe.
