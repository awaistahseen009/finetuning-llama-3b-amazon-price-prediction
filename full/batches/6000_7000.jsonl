Next, the Traxxas EZ-Start system ushered in a new era of convenience and ease of use with true, push-button electric starting. EZ-Start later evolved to incorporate built-in diagnostic functions, LED indicators, a constant-voltage glow plug circuit, and more powerful starter motors. Then came the TRX 2.5, a marvel of award-winning power and technology that set the bar for Ready-To-Race performance to unimaginable new heights. Years of nitro engine development have culminated into the most powerful TRX engine ever made, the TRX 3.3 Racing Engine. It embodies everything we've learned from decades of making engines more powerful, more reliable, and easier to use. The TRX 3.3 Racing Engine is so powerful it establishes a whole new classification of power\u2026. Extreme Power! The TRX 3.3 produces an extreme 60% more peak horsepower compared to the TRX 2.5! The overall power under the curve is nearly 50% greater to deliver the smooth, linear power output TRX engines are famous for. The TRX 3.3 Racing Engine offers thoroughbred race engine performance that's absolutely second to none. There's no penalty to pay for having more power either. The TRX 3.3 Racing Engine is equipped with EZ-Start push-button electric starting and simple, reliable tuning from the two-needle composite slide carburetor.

The insulation test voltages of 500 and 1000V measure resistance from 0.1 to 600 megaohms. Live circuit detection increases user safety by preventing insulation tests when voltages exceed 30V, and auto-discharge of capacitive voltage increases user protection. An audible continuity sensor confirms a circuit conducts electricity. The LCD is backlit for readability in low light. A hold function freezes the reading on the display. An alarm sounds when the test leads are connected to the wrong jack for the measurement being taken. The unit automatically turns off after 20 minutes of nonuse to conserve battery life or can be disabled for extended readings, and a low-battery indicator signals when the meter's batteries need to be replaced. The meter included a set of detachable test leads, a remote probe, alligator clips, a hard case, and instructions.\", \"This true RMS (root mean square) meter provides accurate readings when measuring linear loads, such as standard induction motors and incandescent lights, where the current or voltage has an undistorted waveform, or nonlinear loads, such as electronic devices or motors, where the current or voltage has a distorted waveform. When turned on, the meter is in auto-ranging mode and automatically selects the correct operating range for the property being measured. It can be switched to manual-ranging mode, which allows the operator to choose the appropriate operating range. The display has a 6,000-count resolution, meaning it can display up to 5,999 units (3-3/4 digits) before the operating range needs to be changed. It meets International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) safety standard 61010 and is certified Category III installations up to 1000V, which covers items used with enclosed building circuit installations (such as service panel parts, branch circuits, and fixed installations that are connected directly to a building's AC power supply), Category IV installations up to 600V, which covers equipment at the origin of the installation (such as electricity meters and primary over-current protection equipment), and Pollution Degree 2 for indoor use.\", 'Specifications', \"Insulation test voltages500V, 1000VInsulation measurement range0.1 to 600 megaohmsMaximum AC and DC voltage input1000VMaximum AC and DC current measured60 milliampResistance0.1 ohms to 50 megaohmsAudible continuity buzzerLess than 25 or greater than 100 ohmsPower supply4 AA batteries (NEDA 15A or IEC LR6)Safety ratingsIngress Protection certified IP40; European Conformity (CE); Underwriter's Laboratory (UL) 61010-1; ANSI/ISA S82.01-2004; Canadian Standards Association (CAN/CSA) C22.2 No. 1010.1:2004; International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) safety standards -1; -2; IEC 6101 ['Manual and auto ranging digital insulation multi meter measures insulation resistance, current, voltage, and resistance for testing line insulation on motors, generators, cables, and switch gear', 'True RMS meter provides accurate readings when measuring linear or nonlinear loads where the current or voltage has an undistorted or distorted waveform', 'Insulation test voltages of 550V and 1000V and insulation measurement range of 0.1 to 600 megaohms', 'Live circuit detection prevents insulation test when voltages over 30V are detected', 'Safety ratings include Ingress Protection certified IP40; European Conformity (CE) marking; UL 61010 1; ANSI/ISA S82.01 2004; CAN/CSA C22.2 No. 1010.1:2004; IEC safety standards 61010 1:1002 and 61010.1 04, 1; 2; and IEC/EN 61010 1, 2nd edition for Category III installations up to 1000V and Category IV installations up to 600V, and Pollution Degree 2'] {\"Brand\": \"Fluke\", \"Power "}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Because of the construction of these lenses, it\\'s normally impossible to install filters as there are no filter threads. In addition, standard filter sizes are not large enough to adequately cover the lens\\'s wide angle view. The WonderPana FreeArc changes all that by providing a complete kit for mounting our collection of both round and square filters. The all-metal Core attaches directly onto the lens with a secure mounting system. With the Core in place, you can now mount any of Fotodiox\\'s new \\'slimline\\' 145mm round filters.For even more filter flexibility, mount the WP66 square filter holders (these mount without tools on either side of The Core); once attached the photographer can easily slide in our 6.6\u201d square filters (among the largest and most durable in the business). With the FreeArc, the square filter stage is rotatable 360 degrees. The Wonderpana FreeArc can accommodate either two square filters, or one round and one square simultaneously. Fotodiox Pro ND Filters are true neutral density filters designed to darken the image. They features an even, neutral gray color for creative photography applications. The ND16 filter offers a +4 stop EV value which allows you to slow down the shutter speed or use a larger aperture in bright light conditions. The Graduated Neutral Density darkens the sky while leaving the foreground unaffected, perfect for shooting sunset or sunrises where the sky is blown out and the ground is dark.

A flip tarp system saves both time and money by covering and uncovering a load in seconds with the turn of a switch or the press of a button. It is also a much safer solution, allowing drivers to operate the tarp system from the ground or from inside the cab. What used to be a dangerous, grueling, and labor-intensive task is now one of the easiest parts of the job! Here's how a tarp system works: The tarp is spooled on an axle which is mounted at the front of the dump bed, behind or above the cab. On each side of the dump body, pivot pins are mounted with four spiral torsion springs that apply pressure on the side arms, which cross over the dump bed through a pocket in the tarp. With the turn of a switch, the 1.5 hp Tarp Motor carefully releases the tarp, allowing the tension of the springs to push the arms towards the back of the truck. To uncover the load, the motor winds the axle in the opposite direction, thus pulling the tarp and the arms back to the front of the bed (make sure the tarp spools over the axle, not under). This tarp system is typically paired with a Mesh Dump Truck Tarp or a Vinyl Dump Truck Tarp, but it is compatible with any cover, as long as it has grommets or a spline on one end and a pocket on the other. This automatic tarp kit comes with everything you need for a quick and easy installation (2-5 hours depending on experience). The tarp axle has several options for attaching a tarp, but the most common method is to bolt the tarp to the axle using the included hardware. The system can be adjusted to fit dump bed lengths from 8' to 24', making it one of the most versatile and economical dump truck tarp systems on the market.\"] ['Heavy Duty Rust Proof Aluminum - Gives a polished look while also being lightweight and durable', 'Installation Hardware Kit - Comes with everything you need for a fast and easy installation and a 1-year manufacturers warranty - Tarp Not Included', \"Rotary Switch with 50' of 6-Gauge Dual Conductor Battery Cable - Cover your load from the ground or cab, saving you time and money\", 'Compatible With Any Cover \u2013 Can be used with any cover that has grommets or a spline on one end and a pocket on the other', 'Fits Truck Beds 8-24ft Long and Under 95\" Wide - Versatility makes this an ideal solution to all your tarp system needs - 78\" Lower Arms allow extra length for our system'] {\"Manufacturer\": \"Carolina Tarps\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"December 24, 2018\", \"Brand\": \"Carolina Tarps\", \"Material\": \"Aluminum\", \"Number of Items\": \"1\", \"Size\": \"24' * 95\\\"\", \"Ultraviolet Light Protection\": \"False\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The header is constructed of 1.625 inch 16-gauge 409 stainless steel tubing with 3/8 inch thick head flange to ensure a leak free seal. System was designed and tuned with near symmetrical sides for optimum balance and efficiency of exhaust flow. To eliminate dead space that can cause turbulence and hindering flow that formed collectors are prone to produce, a true merged collector and optimized tube lengths are used for true pulse control technology improving flow and performance. 3/8 inch thick head flange and 100 percent TIG welded construction ensures optimal strength and durability. The smooth curves and increased diameter of this header helps remove restriction and keeps exhaust gas flowing smoothly for improved performance and durability on and off the trails. All components are supplied for a hassle-free installation with no modifications necessary. Mitered collectors extend the tube length into the flange which decreases turbulence and increases exhaust velocity. The result is increased horsepower, torque and improved throttle response.

The DAX66 from Dayton Audio is an affordable, full-featured, six-source, six-zone distributed audio system\u2026your dreams have come true. The DAX66 is a true matrix system allowing a listener in any zone to select from any of the six connected source devices. Four stereo RCA inputs allow you to connect any audio or audio video device like a radio tuner, CD player, Blu-ray DVD player, or satellite/cable TV receiver. Two stereo 3.5mm jacks allow you to connect a personal audio device or a PC. Input six is a shared connection providing a connection for either a Toslink optical cable or a 3.5mm stereo audio cable. Each zone is controlled by a dedicated in-wall keypad with back-lit, soft-touch buttons and LED display. The keypad allows you to change the source, volume level, bass, and treble. When a zone is not active, the power/select button emits a soft blue glow. A built-in IR receiver performs double duty providing zone control by a DAXRC remote control, and control of the source devices using the built-in IR extender. Generous output power is obtained by using class D amplifier circuitry. The DAX66 provides 25 Watts per channel output into 8 Ohm speakers, 50 Watts into 4 Ohm speakers and an impressive 100 Watts into a single 8 Ohms speaker in bridged mono mode. Since each output is discrete you can operate some outputs in bridged mono mode and the other outputs in stereo mode. If you are installing the DAX66 system in a large home or office, you can connect up to two additional systems to the initial system. The additional systems share the 6 source devices and distribute the audio to a maximum of 18 zones. Each zone has stereo pre-amp output that allows you to connect higher-power amplifiers to fill large spaces. Connect a Dayton MA1260 or MA1240 to a pre-amp output to extend a single zone to seven zones.

This \u2018bokeh\u2019 effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens.

Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration.', 'Aspherical lens elements', 'Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight.

Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight.

The sheep gut core of the Passione violin strings is manufactured, wound and polished in the traditional way - by hand. The core sound is full, round and warm and has a complex overtone spectrum causing brilliance and clarity and a great power of projection. Passione strings possess a fascinating diversity of sounds, which allows musicians to alter their tone as desired. These violin strings offer very easy response on all levels of the dynamic range. The accuracy of the contact point is easily manageable, and they boast a significantly reduced playing-in time: Passione strings are immediately playable, unlike some other gut strings. Altering the gauge by 1/4 PM changes the tension by 3%. For some time, a new trend evolved, especially amongst young classical violinists who search for a full and complex sound, to start experimenting with violin strings with a gut core. Pirastro has now picked up this trend and developed the Passione violin string line. E string: Ball end / Silvery Steel A string: Ball end / Aluminium Winding - Gut Core D string: Ball end / Silver Winding - Gut Core G string: Ball end / Silver Winding - Gut Core Special Features The length of coloured silk at the peg end of the Passione G-string is different than the length of the A- and D- strings. This has been designed intentionally and is part of the construction of the G-string. The special length of the G-string\u2019s colour winding at the peg end prevents the string from breaking in the peg box. At the latest after two to three days the stretching process will be finalized. As a result the silk winding will no longer reach over the nut. We have made numerous tests with this special G on various violins all differing in size and the string has always fitted. On some violins it takes longer, with other violins the string even fits from the beginning. About Pirastro strings: Because of the quality of both their strings and rosin, Pirastro has become the byword for a sound which is both beautiful and dependable. As a result, a great number of string musicians play and recommend Pirastro strings. With their tonal flexibility and expressive power, Pirastro strings have inspired musicians to create their own unique sound by taking full advantage of their instruments best qualities. Each individual string in the Pirastro line has been meticulously crafted to provide musicians with an unsurpassed choice in tonal colours. Musicians can choose from the complete range of gut strings (e.g. Passione and Oliv) to synthetic strings (such as Evah Pirazzi and Tonica) or steel (e.g. Flexocor and Chromcor). Finally, Pirastro rosins are designed specifically for use with Pirastro strings and this combination is responsible, in no small part, for the excellent world-renowned Pirastro sound.'] ['Traditional violin strings: Handmade, finely wound and polished gut strings, with increased tuning stability', 'Superior sound: Gut strings offer warm sound, excellent tonal qualities and projection.

The Galaxy S8+ has the world's first Infinity Screen, A screen without limits. The expansive display stretches from edge to edge, giving you the most amount of screen in the least amount of space. The revolutionary design of the Galaxy S8+ begins from the inside out. We rethought every part of the phone's layout to break through the confines of the smartphone screen. So all you see is pure content and no bezel. It's the biggest, most immersive screen on a Galaxy smartphone of this size. And it's easy to hold in one hand. The Infinity Display has an incredible end-to-end screen that spills over the phone's sides, forming a completely smooth, continuous surface with no bumps or angles. It's pure, pristine, uninterrupted glass. And it takes up the entire front of the phone, flowing seamlessly into the aluminum shell. The result is a beautifully curved, perfectly symmetrical, singular object. Capture life as it happens with the Galaxy S8+ cameras. The 12MP rear camera and the 8MP front camera are so accurate and fast that you won't miss a moment, day or night. Prying eyes are not a problem when you have iris scanning on the Galaxy S8+. No two irises have the same pattern, not even yours, and they're nearly impossible to replicate. That means with iris scanning, your phone and its contents open to your eyes only.

With a short and explosive crash, it also works as an alternate ride that is dry and cutting. Vetted in the Zildjian Concept Shop and now available worldwide, FX Raw Crashes are the most unrefined and funky cymbals we\\'ve ever produced! Each Raw Crash starts from Zildjian\\'s secret alloy, but is not hammered, lathed or trimmed, creating a sound and look that\\'s unlike any other cymbal. A cymbal like no other. Raw crashes are not hammered or lathed, which gives each a highly irregular profile and an unrefined surface. They are also not trimmed into a perfect circle, resulting in odd shapes, sizes (max 24\u201d in diameter), and a naturally coarse edge. Altogether, these variations in profile, shape, size and edge consistency are what create the wildly individual sounds from one crash to the next that make these cymbals so special. Unleash an unrefined sound. These cymbals open up easily, producing beautiful dry crashes with great cut, then drop out of the mix, allowing punchy accents and clear stick patterns. The small bell version of the Raw Crash delivers a controlled and dry sound, with less pronounced overtones. The large bell Raw Crash is a bit more open, with a more pronounced bell sound. Both versions offer a focused sound with plenty of stick to compliment any style, making them an excellent choice for an alternative ride cymbal! Their low shapes make them ideal for moderate volume settings where less projection is needed. A completely individual look. Aesthetically, each Raw Crash will feature streaks, splotches and swirls of varying colors. These are created when the hot metal is tempered, and over time, will continue to develop. Some Raw Crashes may show stretch marks from rolling, tool marks and scratches from moving the hot blanks, chalk marks indicating cup location and oven number, and other telltale signs of their journey through the foundry.

The amplification module, with power outputs of 250W RMS is developed with he-li technology (high efficiency / low impedance), which thanks to the absence of the DC-DC voltage booster reaches the impressive 90% efficiency level, very close to the theoretical limit of the D-Class. New input stage DBT (Dynamic Bass Tracking) technology allows 100% use of the he-li (High Efficiency Low Impedance) amplifier power and to enjoy a tense and dynamic bass even at very high listening volumes. Eliminating the voltage booster was made possible thanks to the development of the new dual coil drivers, which inherit all the technological background of the Prima subwoofers, but differ for the ultra low impedance. This feature ensures a perfect synergy with the he-li (High Efficiency Low Impedance) technology, maximizing the combination of amplifier, speakers and sealed box, to obtain low, powerful and crisp frequencies. Features - Integrated 250 W RMS @ 0.4 \u03a9 D-Class amplifier featuring he-li technology (high efficiency / low impedance) without switching power supply, for a performance next to ideal.

By offering multiple management options, these switches allow quick deployment, infrastructure expansion, and seamless upgrades. Targeting small and medium sized businesses, the DGS-1210 Web Smart switches provide functionality, security, and manageability for a fraction of the standard cost of ownership. Equipped with a complete lineup of L2 features, these switches include IGMP Snooping, Port Mirroring, Spanning Tree, and Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). D-Link\u2019s innovative Safeguard Engine protects the switches against traffic flooding caused by virus attacks. The switches also support 802.1X port-based authentication, allowing the network clients to be authenticated through external RADIUS servers. In addition, the Access Control List (ACL) feature enhances network security and protects the network by screening traffic from illegal MAC or IP addresses. ARP Spoofing Prevention prevents malicious intruders from sending massive fake ARP messages through a manipulated source. For added security, the DHCP Server Screening feature blocks rogue DHCP server packets from user ports to prevent unauthorized IP assignment.

All main parts, not only the fins and channels, but the chambers are also made from copper. This brings an improvement in performance where other radiators are left without a chance. In structure, the Alphacool NexXxoS X-Flow Radiators differentiate materially from the standard radiators. The X.Flow Radiators are designed for high flow rates. The beveled copper chambers on both sides have an identical structure. This Water is jetting at the same time through all available channels to the other chamber to which it then leaves the radiator. Versatile and easy mounting is one of the main points, on which the research and development department at Alphacool focused. The chamber offers three possibilities for fitting installation on both inlet and outlet (not on the NexXos ST30). Less angled fittings are needed, improving flow rates and offering more mounting possibilities. Here, too, Alphacool provides the popular sizes of the 120mm series. Different thicknesses, 30mm, 45mm and 60 mm underscore the broad spectrum that cover these radiators.', 'Even mounting and installation of fans and radiator grills is easy and versatile with these radiators: The M3 threads are standard in the radiator sector and available in all lengths at an affordable price. Even the dreaded insertion of a screw too far into the radiator does not result in expensive damage. Unlike other radiators, the NexXxos series is equipped with an internal protective ledge which stops the screw before it damages the fins. Fin spacing is always an important factor in radiator design. The new series from Alphacool has a fin design which allows it to perform extremely well even with slow-spinning and medium-speed fans. This is not only pleasant thanks to the fact that it avoids unnecessary noise; it also means that the choice of fans that can be used with these radiators is not restricted.', 'Model: 14230'] ['Product Type:', 'Technical Details:', 'Dimensions:', 'Scope of Delivery:', 'Compatibility:'] {\"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"18.11 x 5.51 x 1.57 inches\", \"Brand\": \"Alphacool\", \"Cooling Method\": \"Water\", \"Compatible Devices\": \"Radiator\", \"Noise Level\": \"21 dB\", \"Material\": \"Copper\", \"Maximum Rotational Speed\": \"1800 RPM\", \"Item Weight\": \"1.51 pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"18.11 x 5.51 x 1.57 inches\", \"Color\": \"Black\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Alphacool\", \"Country of Origin\": \"Germany\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"March 10, 2016\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port.

The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-90x. The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port (camera sold separately). The WH10x20mm super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces combine with the 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective to provide continuous zoom magnification and a longer working distance for inspecting large-scale specimens that require handling or repair. The microscope comes with 0.5x and 2.0x Barlow lenses that can be added to the objective to increase the magnification range. A Barlow lens with a magnification of less than 1.0 reduces magnification and increases the working distance, while a Barlow lens with a magnification greater than 1.0 increases the magnification and reduces the working distance. High-eyepoint eyepieces ease viewing for users who wear glasses, and dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. A stereo microscope, sometimes called an inspection or dissection microscope, has low magnification and a long working distance that enables users to manipulate the object being inspected.', 'The removable 144-bulb LED ring light provides bright, cool light for working with temperature-sensitive or live specimens. The ring light provides shadow-free illumination, and a rheostat controls the amount of light emanating from the lamp. Power and adjustment controls are located on a separate control box to speed adjustments. The light provides intensity and direction control. The ring has a 2.4\" (61mm) inside diameter and a 4\" (100mm) outside diameter. The light has a 100,000-hour life span, and a 110V-240V variable power supply. The microscope has a double-arm boom stand that enables users to position the microscope head on all three axes (X, Y, and Z). Bilateral focus eases use for left- and right-handed users. The stand has 20\" double arms, and a 30\" overall length. The pillar is 17\" and the focus rack has a 3\" diameter. The solid cast-steel base is 2 x 8-1/4 x 10-1/4 inches (H x W x D, where H is height, the vertical distance from the lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back).', 'Specifications', 'HeadTrinocularMagnification range3.5x-90xZoom objective power0.7x-4.5xEyepieces (DIN, 30mm)WH10x20mm high-eyepointTrinocular portC-Mount or 23mmField of view2-1/2\"Optical working distanceUp to 8\"Microscope standDouble-arm boom standHead movementX-, Y-, and Z-axesIllumination typeEpiscopic (reflected)Light source144-bulb LED ring light with rheostatPower100V-240V', 'Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the reso ['Professional stereo microscope with boom stand has long working distance to enable users to perform work or manipulate large items, including circuit boards and dental appliances', 'Trinocular viewing head with pair of 10x super-widefield eyepieces, adjustable interpupillary distance, fixed 45-degree vertical inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation capability to enable sharing', '0.7x-4.5x zoom objective provides continuous zoom magnification and longer focal length for inspecting large-scale specimens, a 0.5x Barlow lens extends the working distance, and a 2.0x Barlow lens extends the magnification range', 'Removable rheostat-controlled 144-bulb LED ring light provides intensity control and bright, cool light for working with tempe"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}
