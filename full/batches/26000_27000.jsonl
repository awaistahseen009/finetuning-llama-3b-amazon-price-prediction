The trinocular viewing head is customizable and is equipped with a dedicated photo port which works simultaneously with both eyepieces. Precision mechanics provide optimal control over stage movements and focusing. The microscope is equipped with LED-based brightfield illumination, and supports optional accessories for various contrast-enhancing techniques such as darkfield and phase-contrast. Its time-tested design and upgradability have made it a favorite among lab technicians, veterinarians, and teachers.', 'Viewing Head', 'The trinocular viewing head has a comfortable 45\u00b0 incline for viewing while seated or standing, and can be swiveled 360\u00b0. Ocular spacing can be easily customized using sliding interpupillary adjustment. Dual diopters allow both eyepieces to be focused independently. The trinocular photo-port adds a dedicated mounting tube for cameras. The 23mm tube is height-adjustable to fine-tune the focus to match the eyepieces. Its simul-focal design allows simultaneous use with both eyepieces so no switching is necessary.', 'Optics', 'The microscope is equipped with four objective lenses mounted on a rotating turret to quickly move through the various magnifications. The lenses use DIN international standards, and are achromatically corrected to improve clarity and color accuracy. They provide a magnification range from 10X to 1000X when used with the standard 10X eyepieces, ideal for viewing a wide range of specimens including cellular structures and bacteria. Additional 25X eyepieces are included to expand the maximum magnification to 2500X with 6 unique levels.', 'Specimen Stage', \"The 2-layer mechanical stage provides smooth and precise movement for examination of specimen slides. The stage's low-position controls are conveniently placed near the coaxial focus knobs for a streamlined workflow. Examining specimen slides is intuitive and precise for users at any skill level. A convenient lever grouped with the left-side focus knobs can be used to lock and unlock the coarse focus adjustment to prevent damage to the lenses and specimen.\", 'LED Illumination', 'The LED sub-stage lighting provides cool, energy-efficient illumination. The light-source is daylight balanced to produce natural colors. The Abbe light condenser has a high 1.25 numerical aperture for oil-immersion, and an iris diaphragm to optimize contrast and depth-of-field.

Just plug in your turntable, connect the PHO-300 to a standard line-level input of your integrated amp, receiver, or powered speaker, and enjoy your favorite albums and 45s. The PHO-300 is Vincent's newest phono preamp, and it is the perfect solution for anyone who wants to experience a high degree of enjoyment from their music without breaking the bank. But don't confuse this with 'entry level' phono stages from other manufacturers. Vincent only puts its name on high quality audio gear, and this is one of Vincent's smartest designs yet. As with its big brothers, the PHO-701 and PHO-500, the PHO-300 uses an elaborately designed external power supply housed in a separate chassis for a no-compromise approach to sound quality. Feeling is believing. The power unit weighs around three pounds and has impressive heft when held in the hand. This 'separate' approach to power supply and audio circuitry has the advantages of keeping negative effects from your household supply from interfering with your music. Thanks to a massive transformer and superior power regulation, AC power line ripples and interference are completely eliminated. The PHO-300's power supply provides constant, reliable power to the phono amplification circuitry at all times. Fluctuations from your local utility have no impact of the sonic purity of the amplification circuitry. The separate-chassis phono stage unit accommodates both MM moving magnet and MC moving coil cartridges. A front panel switch lets you choose between them. High-quality parts are used throughout the construction for extremely low noise operation. The MM section delivers a greater than 84 dB signal-to-noise ratio, while the MC section delivers greater than 71 dB ratio, with total harmonic distortion of less than 0.02%.

Utilizing an advanced wavetable synthesis engine, 3 Oscillators, dual Wave Mutators and 2 filters that can be configured in series or parallel, the tone generating capabilities are unmatched. As for the performance capabilities, The Hydrasynth Desktop / Rack has 24 polyphonic pressure touch pads so that you can play the unit without needing to connect a keyboard or other controller.

You need them accessible, organized and condensed in as tight a space as possible. Here\u2019s just the system you need to accomplish that, regardless of your clamp size, style or how many you have. Woodpeckers new Clamp Rack-It System takes a modular approach to organizing your clamps. Two sizes of arms can be bolted to the backer plates at a wide variety of spacings. Just find the spacing that most closely matches your clamp bar sizes, use Large Arms for heavy clamps (like parallel jaw and 3/4\" pipe clamps) and Small Arms for lighter duty clamps (F-style and quick action clamps, for example), bolt it all up and start racking. This system shows 43 clamps stored on 3 pairs of large arms and 2 pairs of small arms on just 24 inches of wall space! With more expansion available, by purchasing additional arms separately. The backer plate is 24\" wide. The plates must be attached directly to studs, but we\u2019ve made that easy. The 24\u201d plate can fit 24\u201d or 16\" fits stud-to-stud on a normal stud pattern. If you need more than one backer plate, they\u2019re designed to share lag bolts and fit flush when you butt them end-to-end. The Clamp Rack-It System backer plates and arms are laser cut from 13-gauge steel, formed on CNC equipment and then given a tough, durable powder coat finish. The powder coat will stand up to years of racking and un-racking your clamps, keeping your shop looking as good as your finished projects. All components are available individually. To get you started we\u2019ve bundled the 24\u201d backer plate with 3 pairs of large arms and 2 pairs of small arms (just like the pictures).'] ['Clamps and glue not included', '24\" system used on 24\" studs or 16\" studs'] {\"Manufacturer\": \"Woodpeckers LLC\", \"Item Weight\": \"24.8 pounds\", \"Package Dimensions\": \"28 x 11.5 x 3.5 inches\", \"Material\": \"Other\", \"Date First Available\": \"March 19, 2019\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

When recording in AVCHD Lite, the content is perfect for viewing on an HDTV, like a Panasonic VIERA Plasma. To complement the high-quality video, the Lumix FX75 also features Dolby Digital Creator to record high quality audio. For those users who are recording HD video to view on a computer screen, they also have the option to record in Motion JPEG, as well as WVGA (848x480) and VGA (640x480).

The touch-screen operation is fluid and smooth--whether in record or playback mode.

The system helps create the right lighting balance when capturing images using your UWA and SWA by giving you the ability to use filters on certain lenses where it was not possible to do so before. The WonderPana core unit doubles as a metal hood which gives added protection to the front lens element and the plastic built-in hood that is on many SWA/UWA lenses. The core unit is what provides the photographer a place to attach filters and a dedicated heavy duty snap-on lens cap to protect your unprotected lenses. The WonderPana System is a perfect fit for panorama, nature, architectural, fashion and event photographers, as well as, analog and digital filmmakers.The WonderPana 145 System will work with all Fotodiox Pro 145mm round filters; including Multi-coated UV filters, Circular Polarizers and Neutral Density 4, 8, 16, and 32 filters.

This also allows for smaller lens apertures and/or slower shutter speeds giving you the ability to create amazing photos. By prolonging exposure times, the neutral density filters create the effect of movement in your photos by making anything that moves blurred or ghost-like (clouds, water, etc.). The filters may also be used on cityscapes to blur people or traffic.
