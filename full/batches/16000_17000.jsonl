These \u201csuper clean\u201d designs often leave the signal exiting the preamp sounding much the same as it did entering it, which ends up requiring a lot of work in post-production to get instruments to wake up and sound big in a mix. If you\u2019re looking for a preamp to actually improve and shape your signal instead, you will most definitely love the WA12 MKII Black. This preamp is designed to transform the tone of plain instruments and vocals into exciting sounds that can stand on their own - so if your mixes lack depth, struggle to sound alive, or are just missing that professional touch you\u2019ve always wanted, the the WA12 MKII Black is the affordable answer. Packed With Performance The WA12 MKII Black is a completely discrete, high voltage, dual-transformer microphone preamplifier design with high gain (+71dB), high headroom, low noise, and exciting sonic performance \u2013 which makes it an ideal choice for all types of recording applications. A high-quality mic preamp is one of the most critical pieces needed to achieve that elusive \u2018larger than life\u2019 sound, and the WA12 MKII Black delivers on that promise every single time. Premium Components The WA12 MKII Black is based around the X731 discrete op-amp, which is our own reproduction of the classic Melcor 1731 - considered by some to be the warmer predecessor to the modern 2520-style op-amp. The X731 can achieve vibrant, clean and lifelike tones, but it can also be driven into mild saturation at much higher gain levels. While the effects of that saturation can range from subtle to obvious, they always remain very pleasing to the ear, and because it was designed around the X731 the WA12 MKII Black can accept any discrete op-amp on the market that conforms to the +/-16v, 2520 pinout standard. Our ears played a big part in the process of designing the WA12 MKII Black, and we didn\u2019t stop tweaking until anything we ran through it sounded better. Using CineMag USA transformers and an all-discrete signal path, we ensured that this preamp would have the building blocks to compete with the best-sounding preamps on the market, and we\u2019re very proud to offer such a robust and professional design in a small and affordable package.'] ['Single channel microphone preamplifier and DI with XLR, Balanced and Unbalanced Inputs', 'Custom USA CineMag transformers', 'Fully discrete signal path', 'Discrete 6-pin socketed 1731 style opamp', 'Variable impedance input'] {\"Item Weight\": \"5.93 Pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"14 x 12.7 x 3.75 inches\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"February 23, 2017\", \"Color Name\": \"Black and Orange\", \"Compatible Devices\": \"Amplifier\", \"Connector Type\": \"XLR\", \"Signal Format\": \"Analog\", \"Color Screen\": \"No\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Brand\": \"Warm Audio\", \"Connectivity Technology\": \"XLR\", \"Special Feature\": \"Stand\", \"Color\": \"Black and Orange\", \"Included Components\": \"IEC Cable, Owners Manual\", \"Polar Pattern\": \"Bidirectional\", \"Audio Sensitivity\": \"71 dB\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Designed with two distinct operating mode; the Rotex can be used for coarse sanding or aggressive stock removal and with a flick of a switch used as a finish sander. The aggressive mode operates like an angle grinder with an orbital action but with an added eccentric motion for faster material removal and with gear driven efficiency there is not stopping this sander even in the toughest materials. With a flick of a switch the sander is adapted to a random orbit motion for swirl-free finish sanding to complete your project. The Rotex can even be adapted to a high-torque, low speed polisher for a high gloss finish on nearly any surface. Rotex sanders are equipped with Jetstream dust extraction for highly efficient dust removal. The Jetstream system can extend abrasive life by up to 30% while keeping both the workpiece and the work environment free of dust. Jetstream creates airflow into, across, and through the pad and abrasive. Suction is applied to the outer periphery of holes and draw air from the center of the pad which draws air from outside the pad on it's edges. This creates a circulating effect that moves more air and therefore removes more dust. Jetstream pads and abrasives use the Festool StickFix adhesive system for quick and easy abrasive changes and allow for abrasive discs to be reused. The RO 125 has a 5 inch pad and puts 500 watts of power, dual-mode sanding, and triple-function performance into a comfortable, 4.4 pounds. It is perfect for woodworkers, painters, solid surface fabricators, and anyone who needs to tackle a range of sanding tasks over the course of a day. The RO 125 incorporates near-total dust extraction, exceptional ergonomics, and many advanced features. This is a small sander that is perfect for big jobs.

Pure bare copper is a superior conductor to the copper clad aluminum (CCA) conductors used in most other inexpensive speaker wire. Cca is only about 68% as conductive as pure bare copper. This additional resistance is added to the impedance of your speakers and can negatively effect The sound.for the wire to have no audible effect, The total wire resistance should be no more than 5% of the lowest impedance of your speakers. Even speakers rated for a nominal 8-ohms, may dip to as low as 4-ohms at some frequencies, which further reduces the total cable resistance allowed in the wire. Using pure bare copper speaker wire ensures that the total load put on the amplifier remains as close as possible to the impedance curve of your speakers.for example, a 16AWG 2-conductor pure bare copper speaker wire has a total resistance of 0.803 ohms per 100 feet (both directions must be considered). by comparison, a 16AWG 2-conductor CCA speaker wire has a total resistance of 1.181 ohms per 100 feet. Assuming 4 ohms is the lowest impedance of your speakers, a speaker wire run can be no more 0.2-Ohms total. 20 feet of 16AWG pure bare copper would be 0.1606 ohms, well under the 0.2-Ohm limit. On the other hand, 20 feet of 16AWG CCA would be 0.2362 ohms, well over the 0.2-Ohm limit.each conductor is jacketed with color-coded PVC for easy polarity identification.

This all-analog pedal not only replicates the sound of his full-sized rig, but it also enables him to pipe that massive tone straight to the PA. On top of that, it supplies an expansive range of adjustability, unlocking a wide spectrum of bass tones. If you\u2019re searching for a way to achieve a gargantuan bass sound without a bulky stack of speaker cabs, take the Steve Harris SH1 SansAmp for a test drive \u2014 it delivers a surmounting terror that\u2019s hard to stop.'] ['Bass Preamplifier/DI Pedal with 2 Channels', '4-b Active EQ with \u00b118dB Boost/Cut', 'Analog SansAmp Circuit', 'Chromatic Tuner', 'Bundle includes 3 MXR premium patch cables (6\") and Dunlop variety pick pack'] {\"Item Weight\": \"1.05 pounds\", \"Package Dimensions\": \"10.94 x 3.94 x 1.93 inches\", \"Date First Available\": \"January 28, 2020\", \"Signal Format\": \"Analog\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The \"XT\" stands for extreme. The Motion 35XTi reveals lifelike details from the lightning-fast Folded Motion XT tweeter, open and authentic midrange performance, coupled with deep, musical bass response. These classic performance technologies have been enhanced by the slightest of modifications, including the drive-stabilizing dust cap design and stiffened motor suspension. The Motion 35XTi\u2019s enclosure sports a reinforced baffle and a fabric grille. The success of the Motion Series is directly attributed to its close relation to MartinLogan\\'s legendary ultra-high-end electrostatic loudspeakers. The desire to transmute that level of performance into a more traditional loudspeaker at a more affordable price drove the initial design imperatives that created the Motion Series. MartinLogan\\'s signature Folded Motion tweeter utilizes an extremely low mass diaphragm that \"squeezes\" air, thus demanding significantly less excursion than the typical 1-inch dome tweeter. Its folded design allows for a much larger surface area (compared to that of a regular 1\" dome tweeter), controlled dispersion characteristics, and vanishingly low distortion. It\\'s a miracle of audio engineering that\\'s able to deliver much of the high-frequency detail and speed of a large, dynamic electrostatic panel in a small space. Folded Motion XT tweeters advance thin-film transducer technology even further, with a 40% larger radiating surface and 80x30-degree controlled dispersion. This tweak increases audible bandwidth without sacrificing details and minimizes distortion to an unprecedented level while increasing efficiency and the tweeter\\'s already lightning-fast response time. The superior realism and alarming specificity is aurally astounding.'] ['High Frequency Transducer: 1.25\" \u00d7 2.4\" (3.2cm \u00d7 6.1cm) Folded Motion XT Transducer with 4.5\" x 2.75\" (11.4cm \u00d7 7cm) diaphragm', 'Low Frequency Transducer: 6.5\u201d (16.5cm) aluminum cone with cast polymer basket.

The unit will grind, hone, polish and clean concrete, terrazzo, marble and granite surfaces using diamond abrasives. This is a true planetary gear driven tool. The 10\" platform turns at a lower rate than the higher rotational speed of the 4 inch platens.

The enables users to adopt two console displays from a single DisplayPort 1.2 video source, providing an extended desktop mode and splitter mode at resolutions up to 4K for multitasking across two displays while reducing bulky cable connections. To meet the ever-increasing demand for high-speed peripheral data transmissions, the integrates a USB 3.1 Gen 1 hub to deliver unprecedented data transfer rates up to 5 Gbps - allowing you to maximize multitasking operations. The unique independent switching feature allows the KVM switch's focus to be on one computer while its USB peripheral focus is on another computer.

Ibanez Bass Workshop \u2013 SR \u201cAerium\u201dIf you crave a new bass tool to enrich your creative palette, the Ibanez Bass Workshop may have already built your next instrument. This new product group focuses on combining unusual concepts with the bass-building virtuosity on which Ibanez has built its reputation. Unlike other hollow body basses, the SRH boasts a unique concept: the integration of the authentic feel expected in a hollow body and the key features that distinguish SRH as a contemporary bass. With its sleek, compact, comfortable lightweight body, the SRH breaks another boundary to open up your playing. With its maximized hollow space, Spruce top and Mahogany back and sides, the 55 mm-thick semi-hollow body delivers a rich acoustic tone. The specially designed forearm contour on the body top offers playing comfort, and adds an elegant accent to its appearance. A bound Rosewood fingerboard features black fret lines that balance competing goals for guiding positions and keep the fretboard from disturbing the atmosphere expected in a fretless layout. A contoured neck heel is applied to create a deep neck joint with unfettered access to upper frets. The custom bridge contains the magic of the AeroSilk Piezo system, which works with D'Addario ECB81 flat wound strings to provide that sense of \u201cair\u201d that characterizes the upright sound.\"] ['Neck Shape: Info not available Wood: Jatoba/Bubinga Neck joint: Neck-through Scale length: Info not available Truss rod: Standard Finish: Satin Pickups Active or passive pickups: Passive Pickup configuration: SS Neck: MK-1 Middle: Not applicable Bridge: Not applicable Brand: AeroSilk Series or parallel: Info not available Active preamp: Not applicable Special electronics: Piezo preamp Fretboard', 'Ibanez Bass Workshop \u2013 SR \u201cAerium\u201dIf you crave a new bass tool to enrich your creative palette, the Ibanez Bass Workshop may have already built your next instrument', 'This new product group focuses on combining unusual concepts with the bass-building virtuosity on which Ibanez has built its reputation', 'Unlike other hollow body basses, the SRH boasts a unique concept: the integration of the authentic feel expected in a hollow body and the key features that distinguish SRH as a contemporary bass', 'With its sleek, compact, comfortable lightweight body, the SRH breaks another boundary to open up your playing'] {\"Item Weight\": \"3.6 Kilograms\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"50 x 17.75 x 4.5 inches\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"January 20, 2017\", \"Back Material\": \"Rosewood, Mahogany, Wood, Basswood, Bubinga, Spruce Wood\", \"Color Name\": \"Natural Browned Burst Flat\", \"Scale Length\": \"864 Millimeters\", \"Top Material\": \"Rosewood, Mahogany, Spruce\", \"Number of Strings\": \"5\", \"Brand\": \"Ibanez\", \"Color\": \"Natural Browned Burst Flat\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"50 x 17.75 x 4.5 inches\", \"Top Material Type\": \"Rosewood, Mahogany, Spruce\", \"Back Material Type\": \"Rosewood, Mahogany, Wood, Basswood, Bubinga, Spruce Wood\", \"Finish Type\": \"Powder Coated\", \"Instrument\": \"Guitar\", \"Operation Mode\": \"Electric\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-90x. The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing.

Featuring an improved overall package, it now provides variable attack and release knobs, lower noise, and increased range on threshold and output gain. For mastering, an enhanced link mode lets CH1 output control act as a master level control while CH2' output control becomes a balance control. Another feature for mastering is the inclusion of pots with detents, which makes settings repeatable. The Pro VLA II is designed to excel in tracking, mixing, mastering, live sound, or broadcast situations. The Pro VLA by ART is a tube driven Vactrol-based Compressor/Leveling amplifier designed to excel in any professional audio application, including tracking, mixing, mastering, live sound or broadcast situations. By using an opto-electronic design, (as opposed to a more typical VCA driven level detection circuit) the Pro VLA II allows more compression to be added to an audio source with a more natural, musical sounding output and virtually transparent dynamic leveling. This VCA-less design coupled with a 12AT7 vacuum tube in the gain stage makes the Pro VLA II tube compressor the ideal dynamic control device for critical studio and live sound applications. These are the differences between the Pro VLA and the Pro VLA II: 1. Enhanced Link mode In link mode, CH1 output control acts as a master output level and CH2 becomes a Balance control. This optimizes the Pro VLA II for use as a mastering processor. 2. Active balanced outputs. The old VLA has balanced outputs that have 6dB more gain than when using them in the unbalanced mode.

In the latter case, the SC305 will work perfectly as a center channel, if we\\'re talking about a smaller system. The SC305 combines the power from three different amplifiers to deliver a very efficient, dynamic and low noise sound reproduction. With its moderate size and superb technical characteristics, the SC305 model has virtually no competition on the market today. Don\\'t miss the chance and check them out for yourself! Tech TalkEVE\\'s three-way systems are designed around the concept to distribute the frequencies properly between all individual components and raise the efficiency of your speakers effectively. With the SC305 one of the woofers is delivering sound only up to 350 Hz, functioning as a kind of \"bass woofer\". The other woofer gives you a fuller range up to the 3000 Hz crossover frequency as a bass-midrange driver. This means less effective physical work being made by each individual woofer, which in turn will result in less mechanical inertia and a more efficient sound transmission. Both woofers consist of EVE\\'s proprietary 5\" SilverCone, the same that is used in the smaller SC205 model. However, due to the fact that two of these woofers are being used simultaneously, you get a bigger frequency response - down to 50 Hz. The SC305 also makes use of the proprietary AMT RS3 tweeter, which uses a bigger front plate and a bigger internal magnet to drive the AMT tweeter with greater efficiency. The three 50 W PWM power amplifiers won\\'t leave you lacking any power either. All in all, the SC305 will probably be regarded as the single most detailed three-way monitor speaker in the market for its specific size and price range. And no worries determining how to place the SC305 in your room or studio properly.

By interpolating video data using proprietary algorithms, SD format data is up-converted to 1080x1920p HD format video data. This conversion increases the richness of the original data by almost six-fold, producing the highest possible image quality when viewing content on a large-screen HDTV. Just slip the SD card into the slot or use the cable to connect the camera to the USB terminal, and you're ready to enjoy a spectacular big-screen slideshow with family and friends. You can even listen to music recorded onto a USB device while viewing your photos. Connect your Panasonic DVD recorder to a flat-panel HDTV via an HDMI cable and the TV channel setting information is automatically downloaded to the recorder. Once the Auto Preset Download is complete, the DVD recorder will keep whichever TV channel you're watching as its receiving channel.

The pedal\u2019s based on a design from veteran pedal builder Paul Cochrane that\u2019s widely celebrated among high level pros, from first-call Nashville player Kenny Greenberg to first-call L.A. player Lyle Workman to rockstar Brad Whitford. When Paul decided to bring his pedal to a wider audience, he chose to work with the MXR design team. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to work with MXR,\u201d Paul says. \u201cMy first ever pedal was a Phase 90.\u201d', 'Thanks to Paul\u2019s inventive implementation of clipping options and tone controls, the Timmy Overdrive is a dream come true for working guitar players. The Clip switch provides three different clipping styles for a multitude of scenarios, whether you need a big, bold always-on sound with a ton of headroom to slam the front end of your amp, a more compressed and saturated sound for fat chords, or anything in between. The Bass and Treble controls offer further refinement in two key ways. First, they\u2019re cut-only, keeping your signal\u2019s character intact while making it super easy to dial in a clean boost. Second, Paul wired the Bass control to affect your pre-OD signal so that you can your maintain low end at lower Gain settings and the Treble control to affect your post-OD signal so that you can adjust the top end to keep dirty settings smooth and musical.', 'Finally, the MXR design team worked with Paul to select an op-amp that perfectly complements his expertly crafted design. They chose the LF353, a component well-respected by Dunlop engineers for providing high output, high gain, and hi-fi signal delivery. The resulting MXR Timmy Overdrive is a professional-grade must-have for players who want sweet, harmonic breakup that responds to playing dynamics and maintains a rig\u2019s personality at a fraction of the standard pedal size.'] ['The MXR Timmy Overdrive is a professional-grade must-have for players who want sweet, harmonic breakup that responds to playing dynamics and maintains a rig\u2019s personality at a fraction of the standard pedal size', 'This pedal provides a huge, responsive range of gritty and textured tones that enhance the sound of your rig while preserving its fundamental character', 'Clip switch provides three different clipping styles for a multitude of scenarios', 'MXR mini housing', 'Includes 2 MXR premium 6\" patch cables, and Dunlop variety pack of 12 picks.
