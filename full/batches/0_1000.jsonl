The detector has an alphanumeric LCD screen that shows real-time concentration of four monitored gases, the alarm type, the calibration requirements, the self-test pass or fail, and the battery life remaining. The LCD also displays a constant flashing heartbeat icon to indicate normal functioning. The detector is operated and adjusted with a single push button. It is used to indicate potentially harmful levels of gases naturally occurring in the environment; in a variety of occupational settings such as petroleum refineries, tanneries, sewage treatment facilities, and paper mills; and in other personal safety, educational, and ambient monitoring applications.', 'This detector is set to alert to when gas levels reach any of four limits: a low-alarm level, indicating moderate danger; a high-alarm level, indicating significant danger; a short-term exposure limit (STEL), the maximum gas concentration to which workers can be exposed continuously for a short period of time without serious risk; and a time-weighted average (TWA) limit, the maximum average exposure that personnel can experience over an eight-hour work shift without serious risk. The 95 dB audible alarm sounds at different speeds to indicate the alarm type, and the five bright, LED alarm bars and the built-in vibration alarm help alert the user to potentially dangerous levels of gases in high-noise conditions. The detector logs and retains data of the 10 most recent gas exposure events, which it can transmit via an infrared Datalink USB adapter to a personal computer (both sold separately).', 'This product is powered by a rechargeable lithium polymer battery that provides up to 13 hours of operational life per charge. To ensure performance, the detector tests its sensor integrity, circuitry, and audible and visual alarms upon activation. It tests its battery upon activation and continuously during operation. The detector also features an automatic shutdown mode for additional safety, which activates when the detector fails its self-test. This detector comes with a back-mounted alligator clip to allow the unit to be worn on a belt, waistband, or lapel, and a concussion-resistant boot to help protect it against damage. It is water resistant, and is compatible with the BW Technologies MicroDock II automatic test system (sold separately).

See manual for details. Improved tremolo response across all rates. Top mounted jacks. Inspired by the beautifully jagged, red-sand desert landscape of Monument Valley, the Monument tremolo is both a harmonic, and standard tremolo that produces a rich, luscious, warm pulsating modulation capable of peaks and valleys as smooth or as jagged as the real ones that our dear mother nature created long ago.

['FOAMED- : Any solid material adjacent to a conductor is actually part of an imperfect circuit. Wire insulation and circuit board materials all absorb energy (loss). Some of this energy is stored and then released as distortion. Golden Gate uses air-filled Foamed-Polyethylene Insulation on both conductors because air absorbs next to no energy and Polyethylene is low-loss and has a benign distortion profile. Thanks to all the air in Foamed-PE, it causes much less of the out-of-focus effect common to other materials. METAL-LAYER NOISE- SYSTEM (NDS): 100% shield coverage is easy. Preventing captured RF Interference from modulating the equipment\u2019s ground reference requires AQ\u2019s Noise-Dissipation System. Noise-Dissipation System prevents a significant amount of RFI from reaching the equipment\u2019s ground plane. DOUBLE-BALANCED ASYMMETRICAL GEOMETRY: Purpose designed for single-ended applications, Double-Balanced Asymmetrical Geometry offers a relatively lower impedance on the ground for a richer, and more dynamic experience. While many single-ended cable designs use a single path for both the ground and the shield, Double-Balanced designs separate the two for cleaner, quieter performance. COLD-WELDED GOLD-PLATED RCA PLUGS: This plug design allows for a connection devoid of solder, which is a common source of distortion.

The longer answer is Sprint Booster reprograms the acceleration signals in your stock ECU, your car will immediately feel faster and accelerate quicker - we guarantee it. Perhaps that\\'s why Sprint Booster has fans around the world and why we are constantly adding hundreds of thousands of users to our list of satisfied customers every year.

It offers features far beyond what is available from others. With the V20, you are not limited by one undersized or over sized driver that only ejects some of the nails it encounters. Instead, the V20 provides you the choice of one of three driver sizes, differing only by diameter (4 mm, 5 mm, and 6 mm) -- each specially suited for the project at hand and interchangeable in the same tool. The 6 mm (V20-60) to drive the heads of pallet nails into the stringers so you can lift off a broken deck board and replace it, the 5 mm (V20-50) as the workhorse for your deconstruction crew as it processes lumber, or the 4 mm (V20-40) for nails in sheathing or cleats in flooring, reportedly working up to 10 times faster than by hand - without marring the exposed surfaces. In other denailers, the driver blade extends beyond the end of the nose a fixed distance. In the V20, the extension length is adjustable. You can then set face nails to any desired depth, up to 3/4 of an inch (19mm). You can punch four sizes of holes through light-gage metal. The V20 is designed and built for industrial use 24/7. One customer reported at least 13 tons of nails removed with one V20 in 2013. The V20 is designed to be safe. Even when accidentally left unattended, the spring-loaded nose provides continuous protection from a moving driver blade. The tool is shipped pre-assembled with the selected driver in a plastic carry case with slots for snapping up to 3 driver/nose sets into it. Also included are an Allen wrench and driver bit for changing drivers, one extra driver o-ring, a small oil bottle, a pry bar for releasing a stuck driver, and a 24 page manual in English, Spanish, and French.'] ['V20-40: Drive nails out of flooring, plywood, siding, pallet boards.

The compact Electro-Voice Tour-X is an ideal floor monitor for use on small to medium-sized stages and offers quality high output for vocal and instrument applications. This Electro-Voice monitor uses signal-synchronized transducers that align the woofer and compression driver by locating them on separate baffles, and integrates a low distortion port between the baffles. This offers tremendous advantages over traditional flat baffle construction: the acoustic centers of the woofer and compression driver are closer together, synchronizing arrival time; the voice coils of the compression driver and woofer are in the same plane, achieving linear phase response; and the size of both baffles are smaller than a single baffle; resulting in a smaller footprint. The Tour-X also utilizes the DH3, high output 1.25\" titanium compression driver, coupled to a constant directivity 90 x 50 horn. The 15\" woofer has an FEA optimized magnet structure and shorting ring for ultralow distortion. The crossover uses steep 24 dB/octave slopes with equalization for very smooth response in vocal range, and has a built-in protection circuit for long term reliability. The combination of the transducers, enclosure, and crossover results in a compact floor monitor that is capable of very high output levels before feedback. The Electro-Voice monitor has a variety of features that make it suited for floor monitor use. The internally braced enclosure is constructed out of a combination of plywood and MDF, and coated with EVCoat for maximum strength and durability. The unique grille design is very strong and dent resistant, and features a rotatable logo. Four way handles allow for gripping the in a variety of positions.

In response to overwhelming requests by our customers, we have brought technological advancements together that will deliver unprecedented performance in our new Sensored motor line. Why Sensored? drivers in all applications demand clean starts when coming off the line. Crawler fans require high-precision low speed control and torque for climbing, racers need precision and predictability, and dragsters don't have a millisecond to spare. To achieve all of these performance demands and more, we have integrated rotor position sensor technology with our improved high power and high efficiency motor design. Through the use of our sensors, the position of the rotor is always known by the ESC. This eliminates the possibility of encountering cogging or inconsistency during startup. Users will experience precise throttle control and buttery smooth starts plus the raw power and longer run times that our highly efficient motors produce. Our improved 4-pole 12-slot design boasts exceptional efficiency and produces less heat. Quietsense technology shields the sensors from magnetic field noise generated from the motor coils and keeps your motor and ESC in sync at all times. Use of a Flux shield in conjunction with secondary sense magnets delivers even higher precision and more efficient startups. Our optimized design eliminates the need for mechanical timing adjustments. Our sensor alignment method delivers uniform timing and torque in both directions, automatically. Rebuildable design allows users to replace front end bell/bearing assembly or rotor/shaft assembly. Roar standard sensor port and labeled connections.

NAD\u2019s veteran engineers know exactly where to spend just a little extra money for a better quality part, in order to extract the very best sound from the Compact Disc. CD Players use mechanical, digital, and analog technology to produce sound, and all three forms of engineering greatly affect the end result and require careful design and engineering. A solid mechanical foundation is paramount in reducing external vibration and providing precise location of the CD drive mechanism. This allows smooth operation and a minimum of tracking errors. Heavy gauge steel and non-resonant plastic moldings are carefully engineered to provide optimum results. The transport is mounted on reinforced steel rails and over 30 fasteners are used to lock the assembly together and maintain precise dimensional integrity. Precise clocking of the digital data stream allows the Wolfson 24 bit DAC to provide accurate linearity for the PCM data conversion to analog waveform. Audio OP Amps buffer the output without adding noise or distortion to the music. Multi-layer PCBs using surface mount components allow for an enhanced circuit layout with very short signal paths. Powering these elements is a custom designed active power supply that provides multiple regulated voltages to the transport, digital circuits, analog circuits, and the control and display circuits. The result of this careful engineering is a sound that is at once both detailed and natural, with dramatic dynamic contrasts. The NAD C 538 includes many desirable features that enhance listening pleasure. Front panel controls are duplicated on the hand held remote allowing Play, Pause, Skip, and Scan functions. In addition, many more features are available from the remote handset, such as RANDOM: Tracks/files are played at random mode, : Enter or exit program mode, REPEAT: Track, file, folder or whole disc is repeated, RPT A-B: Playback sequence is repeated. The dimmable dot matrix display shows tracks, total playing time. Track time, disc time, and remaining time are all available. The C 538 also can play CD-R/CD-RW discs allowing you to burn songs from your computer for playback on your CD Playing system. Because these songs are encoded in MP3 or WMA format, you can fit up to 10 hours of music on a single disc which is great for party mixes and ambient listening. There are also both optical and coaxial digital outputs that allow connection to an external DAC or digital component (like an AVR) to provide the most efficient and best sounding system setups. Although music downloads and streaming continue to grow in popularity, CDs are still the primary listening source for millions of people around the world.

It uses an ergonomic design for comfort and a fluid workflow, and its achromatic optics provide sharp, color-correct images. The halogen illumination system provides low-fatigue, evenly-distributed light for maximum contrast and definition. This model is a popular choice for veterinarians and university laboratories. Specialized darkfield optics allow you to observe live cells including blood and other fluids, making it a great choice for clinics and medical labs. The trinocular head accommodates viewing through eyepieces and through the top-mounted photo port. The binocular viewing tubes use Siedentopf adjustment to easily fit any user. The head has a top-mounted, height-adjustable 23mm photo port for mounting optional cameras. C-mount cameras can be paired with various reduction lenses for mounting to the port and optimizing field-of-view. The objective turret provides instant access to 4 magnification levels to easily focus in on minute details from 40X to 1000X. This covers magnifications needed for studying hair follicles, cells, and bacteria. The turret's reversed orientation provides more working room above the stage. These high-quality lenses are achromatically corrected to improve resolution and color accuracy. The large 2-layer mechanical stage provides smooth and precise movement for examination of specimen slides. The stage's low-position controls are conveniently placed near the coaxial focus knobs for a streamlined workflow. Examining specimen slides is intuitive and precise for users at any skill level. Built on Koehler illumination principals, the sub-stage lighting provides evenly-distributed light for optimal contrast. The halogen light-source provides bright illumination with a lower color-temperature for decreased fatigue when used for long periods. The Abbe light condenser has a high 1.25 numerical aperture for oil-immersion, and an iris diaphragm to optimize contrast and depth-of-field. The condenser holder uses rack-and-pinion height adjustment for precision control, and is centerable for proper alignment. The illuminator's field lens provides an iris diaphragm to control light-spread, optimizing contrast and definition in specimen features. An oil darkfield condenseris included for darkfield observation using high-power objective lenses. The condenser is designed for use with immersion oil, and can accommodate higher numerical-aperture lenses. Darkfield observation will provide contrast in otherwise indistinguishable objects by highlighting changes in refractive index. This is particularly useful for observing live cells including blood analysis.

It uses a Silent Wave Motor for fast, quiet autofocus, and includes one ED and one aspheric element in its optical construction. It's not to be confused with the cheaper AF-S FX Nikkor 35mm f/1.8G, which is for FX format cameras only. Auto-focus troubleshooting: If desired, autofocus can be over-ridden by rotating the lens focus ring while the shutter-release button is pressed halfway (or, if the camera is equipped with an AF-ON button, while the AF-ON button is pressed). To refocus using autofocus, press the shutter-release button halfway or press the AF-ON button again. Unleash the power of your high-resolution Nikon HD-SLR. The AF-S NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G ED draws maximum definition and image quality from Nikon's high-pixel-count image sensors for truly dazzling photos and HD videos. It brings the outstanding optical characteristics of AF-S NIKKOR 35mm f/1.4G to Nikon's f/1.8 FX-format prime lens collection, which includes 28mm, 50mm and 85mm versions. With 63\u00b0 of coverage, ED and AS glass elements for outstanding contrast and minimal distortion, Nikon's innovative Silent Wave Motor for fast, quiet, precise autofocusing and a lightweight, compact design, the AF-S NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G ED is an outstanding choice for your photo or HD video applications. On an FX-format Nikon camera, a 35mm lens approximates the angle of view we see with our eyes, an ideal perspective for so many photo and HD video applications. The AF-S NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G ED combines that natural perspective (52.5mm equivalent on DX-format cameras) with an f/1.8 maximum aperture for outstanding depth of field control and low-light performance\u2014all in a compact, lightweight design. Capture vibrant natural looking photos and HD videos with softly blurred backgrounds, even in low light. A great lens draws peak performance from a camera, and the AF-S NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G ED is no exception. Impressive on Nikon's FX- and DX-format D-SLRs, it delivers consistent, superlative performance, even in tough shooting situations. Aspherical (AS) and Extra-low Dispersion (ED) glass elements combat sagittal flare at wide aperture settings. Super Integrated coatings (SIC) enhance contrast and color and nearly eliminate ghosting, even in backlit scenes. And Nikon's innovative Silent Wave Motor (SWM) uses ultrasonic waves for fast, accurate, quiet autofocusing. The AF-S NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G ED completes Nikon's versatile collection of advanced f/1.8 FX-format prime lenses, joining the 28mm, 50mm and 85mm versions. All four lenses offer the latest Nikon advancements and optical design characteristics, providing consistent performance at each focal length: wide-angle, standard and medium telephoto.\", 'From the Manufacturer', \"Compact, fast FX-format 35mm prime lens that excels on Nikon's high-resolution HD-SLRs.\", \"Unleash the power of your high-resolution Nikon HD-SLR.

Two mighty characters start the new collection with the return of the angry green monster, HULK! The fully powered version of gamma-irradiated Bruce Banner (portrayed in the Avengers films by Mark Ruffalo), the Hulk is an unstoppable titan of rage and ferocity who's just as much a threat to his allies as he is to his enemies. Don't make him angry! Unrestrained and fully unleashed, Bruce Banner has left the building and the Hulk is in control. The massive green-skinned monster hurtles into battle, thick legs pumping and his enormous hands squeezed into fists to pummel anything that tries to stop him. The Hulk conveys a huge presence with his heroic proportions and rippling physique that stands out with every muscle on display. The Avenger is fantastically detailed with intricate anatomy down to his sinews and veins, all topped off by a fierce facial sculpt that captures the character's never-ending rage! This time around the Hulk does things a little differently, wearing high tech red-striped purple shorts rather than the traditional tattered pants. Sculpted by the same master artist who did the Avengers Marvel Now series, Junnosuke Abe (), the new Hulk stands 9 1/2 inches tall (in the ARTFX+ 1/10th scale) as he charges into the fray. He strides powerfully across a brick street, destroying the surface as he goes with every step of his massive bare feet.

Matte Black makes a statement in your space, cultivating a sophisticated air and coordinating flawlessly with most other fixtures and accents.

One valve offers three function options: single-function pressure balance, dual-function pressure balance, and a new dual-function thermostatic valve cartridge. Delta Faucet Company is the first and only manufacturer to offer the ability to install both pressure balance and thermostatic cartridges in one valve.

Viewing with a large aperture can provide a stellar experience, however the size of large reflector telescopes can pose problems for users looking to either store or transport their telescope from one location to another. The Sky-Watcher Collapsible Dobsonian solves this problem with a unique collapsible design using three retractable steel struts, allowing for easy storage and transit.', 'Transport Anywhere, Anytime', 'Dobsonians are known for giving users a large aperture reflecting telescope at a low price, however they often lack portability. Sky-Watcher has innovated this classic telescope design by integrating a collapsible tube system, addressing users\u2019 portability concerns. Sky-Watcher Collapsible Dobsonians feature a strut system carefully designed to ease setup time in the field while delivering consistent optical performance. Each strut has preset indentations which place the optics in the same position time after time, maintaining collimation. Unlike Dobsonians using a truss-tube system, Sky-Watcher\u2019s Collapsible Dobsonian does not need to be disassembled. The strut system is comprised of three 1\u201d steel poles, joining the bottom and top portion of the optical tube. When extended, three chrome locking screws hold the instrument in place. Unlike truss tube Dobsonians, Sky-Watcher\u2019s Collapsible Dobsonian holds collimation extremely well, forgoing the need to collimate each time it\u2019s used. The retracting design can shorten the optical tube up to 36%, making storage and transit much easier.', 'Borosilicate? Gesundheit!', 'At the heart of any Sky-Watcher telescope are observatory-grade optical components. The Collapsible Dobsonian is no exception, using components that yield exceptional contrast, 94% reflectivity and minimal vignetting. Mirrors are constructed with borosilicate glass, then coated with quartz, titanium and silicon dioxide to ensure an unparalleled viewing experience. Combining these superb optics with a large Dobsonian aperture helps ensure you\u2019ll have bright, bold views of faint deep sky objects. To ensure Sky-Watcher Dobsonians remain easy to use, all Collapsible Dobsonians include a mount base that is so smooth, it can be rotated with the push of a finger. 8\u201d and 10\u201d models come complete with Teflon\u2122 bearings, while the larger 12\u201d, 14\u201d and 16\u201d models use steel needle bearings to ensure smooth and easy movement.', 'Upgraded Pro Models', 'Sky-Watcher\u2019s 14\u201d and 16\u201d Collapsible Dobsonian Pro models offer a few additional upgrades.

In studios, live sound, and broadcast facilities, breakdown is unacceptable. Equipment failure or poor performance is costly. The same is true of today's home theater.

When connecting sensitive equipment to your home's power outlet, AC noise couples into your system's critical components. This AC noise masks low level signals and cripples performance. This low level content is critical because it relays the crucial harmonics and ambience in audio, as well as the depth and clarity in video. With Furman's exclusive Linear Filtering Technology, televisions, projectors, DVD players, amplifiers, and processors are fed linearly filtered AC power. This dramatically reduces noise, ensuring consistent peak operation regardless of load conditions or the time of day. For the first time, you will see and hear your theater or audio system as it should be -- uncompromised. Another critical feature is Furman's exclusive Series Multi-Stage Protection. This virtually maintenance-free surge suppression assures the highest level of AC protection possible, without sacrificing itself when the offending surge is severe -- no damaged equipment, no service calls, no down time. Further, Furman's famous retractable front panel LED lamps allow easy viewing of either a rack or cabinet full of equipment, even when your theater lights are off. The Elite-15 PF i also features remote control capability via 12V triggering, compatible with the 12V triggering devices commonly found in power receivers and pre-amp processors.

Wiseco is unique because all of the pistons are forged in house and all of the forge tooling is produced right here. This allows a control of all aspects of the manufacturing process from raw bar to skirt coating finished parts. In addition, in-house dyno testing gives Wiseco the ability to develop state-of-the-art technology such as new shapes, coatings and components and lead the industry through rigorous research and development. Linking all segments of Wiseco's organization through design, testing, manufacturing and distribution helps to fulfill market needs with minimum lead-times. Extreme racing conditions demand the strength and toughness that only forged pistons can offer. Compared to cast pistons, forgings are tougher and more durable and will stand up to the abuse that high performance motorsport applications require. Most castings are brittle, have no grain structure and tend to fail catastrophically when the material yield strength is exceeded. Forgings have condensed grain that is aligned to the features of the part, which produces higher mechanical properties and resistance to impact and fatigue.
