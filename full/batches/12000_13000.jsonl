For many applications, the speed of digital communication is important. Most visibly, \u201cspeed\u201d is about transferring large files as quickly as possible, or carrying enough data for HD video. For Digital Coax audio \u201cspeed\u201d is critical not because of how-much how-fast, but because time relationships within a digital stream are critical to the reconstruction of the analog waveform that brings information, music and joy to our ears. Time-based damage (jitter) to this information within the data package makes the sound small and flat instead of 3D, harsh and foggy instead of smooth and clear. SOLID 10% SILVER : Solid conductors eliminate strand-interaction distortion and reduce jitter. Solid silver-plated conductors are excellent for very high-frequency applications. These signals, being such a high frequency, travel almost exclusively on the surface of the conductor. As the surface is made of high-purity silver, the performance is very close to that of a solid silver cable, but priced much closer to solid copper cable. This is an incredibly cost effective way of manufacturing very high-quality digital coax cables. HARD-CELL FOAM : Hard-Cell Foam insulation is used exclusively in most of AudioQuest\u2019s video and digital audio cables. Similar to Foamed-PE, it is nitrogen injected to create air pockets. \u2018Hard\u2019 foam is used because the stiffness of the material allows the conductors in the cable to maintain the same relationship, thus ensuring that the characteristic impedance of the cable is consistent.

The purpose of the ND grad is to reduce the brightness of selected areas of the frame, balancing out the exposure throughout the frame. A true neutral density grad should have no impact on color balance, and because LEE filters are perfectly neutral, your images will be true to what you see in nature. The transition between the clear and neutral density portions of a soft edge graduated filter is less sharp and more subtle than in a hard edge graduated filter. A soft edge grad filter is recommended when the variation in light readings within a scene is less pronounced or the horizon line has any deviation, such as mountains, trees or rock formations. The soft edge grad filter is also used on occasions when the effect of a hard edge grad would be apparent in the resulting image, showing as a \u2018line\u2019 across the composition.

And Bose new Stay Hear Max tips create an airtight seal with your ear canal critical for hearing the deep low notes that add impact and emotion to your music and for blocking the ambient noise around you so you can focus on your music and your workout. Bose Sport Earbuds come with three sizes of Stay Hear Max tips, so you can find the right fit for you. Every surface that touches your ear is made of soft silicone. Meanwhile, the unique umbrella-shaped tip and the extended flexible wing keep your Bose Sport Earbuds securely in place without need of an ear hook no matter how much you shake your head or jump up and down.Bose Sport Earbuds go through rigorous quality testing for durability.

If you get a phone call, instead of interrupting your workout, simply tap the right earbud or press and hold it to reject. If you answer, you\u2019ll hear the call clearly in both ears. Meanwhile, your caller will hear you clearly, too, thanks to the beam forming microphone array that separates your voice from surrounding noise.Bose Sport Earbuds provide up to 5 hours of battery life per charge.

The status lights on each earbud will pulse white, while they charge before turning solid white and then off when fully charged. When the case is fully charged, it can provide a 15-minute quick charge for up to 2 more hours or two full charges for up to 10 more hours.Bose Sport Earbuds offer complete freedom of movement.

Canon\\'s superlative proprietary imaging technologies help deliver video and 8.0 megapixel photos with incredible detail and lifelike color. Touch & Track allows you to achieve sharp focus and precise exposure for any subject, simply by touching the generous 3.5\" High Resolution (922,000 dot) Touch Panel LCD. Native 24p Mode perfectly matches the frame rate of film. And 5.1-Channel Surround Sound ensures your audio complements the stunning realism of your video. Flash Memory The VIXIA HF S20 can record up to 12 hours of the most crisp, high definition video possible, with a 32GB internal flash drive. It is also equipped with two SD memory card slots, but it gets even better. With Relay Recording, the camcorder automatically switches video recording from the internal drive to the next available SD memory card, when the memory becomes full. It will be easier than ever to capture that late game play or the exact moment those first steps are taken. You\\'ll also have the flexibility of copying video from your VIXIA HF S20\\'s internal drive to one of the two removable SD memory cards, or from one card to the other. That makes it easy to insert the card into your computer or HDTV\\'s card reader and view your recorded footage immediately. MXP and FXP modes record in 1920 x 1080 and require a Class 4 or higher SDHC Card. The advantages of flash memory go beyond the added recording time. You\\'ll also appreciate the quick response time, because there are no moving parts. Press the record button and your VIXIA HF S20 starts recording video faster than you\\'ve ever seen before. In addition, when you review, you\\'ll have quick access to your footage. Another plus is the VIXIA HF S20\\'s low power consumption rate, allowing your battery to last longer. It\\'s just what you need so you don\\'t miss that pivotal play on the field or the moment when they say \"I do.\" While we certainly hope you keep your VIXIA HF S20 securely in your hand while shooting, if it happens to slip, or you accidentally knock it against something, you\\'ll be happy to know that flash memory makes your camcorder more shock-resistant than other recording storage systems. It also minimizes the chance of data loss if there is damage to your recording media or to the moving parts found in other camcorders.

Over the past four-plus decades there\u2019s a resounding theme from Taylor Guitars: passion for improving the guitar-playing experience. As a company that\u2019s passionate about exposing more players to the pleasures of making music, Taylor isn\u2019t content to see people throw in the towel before they have a chance to get their groove on. The Academy Series, which includes the Academy 12e Grand Concert, represents Taylor\u2019s effort to support the development of the entry-level guitar player. Taylor believes that in many respects a player who is just beginning deserves the best-playing guitar. Most newcomers to the instrument \u2014 and parents buying for their kids \u2014 are understandably reluctant to pony up for a more expensive, \u201cnice\u201d brand of guitar without knowing whether the interest will last. So the approach tends to be: start with an inexpensive, \u201cgood-enough\u201d guitar, and if things progress, upgrade to something better. But all too often this ends in hand-wringing frustration, where would-be music-makers walk away from the instrument blaming themselves for not having enough musical talent or physical dexterity, when, in fact, the real culprit all along was the guitar. The Playing Experience Academy Series guitars, like this Academy 12e Grand Concert, are designed to offer enough immediate gratification to encourage a new player to keep playing. To do so, the playing experience was Taylor\u2019s priority: ? Easy to hold and play: The body is comfortable and lightweight, and easy to strum and fret ? Rewarding sound: Yields a good sound easily in the hands of a newer player ? Not too precious: Durable, minimal, so it's not intimidating for a novice to play and care for ?

This guitar is built using a larger \u201cArtist\u201d or F-Style Mandola type body to increase the resonant air chamber providing more volume, better low-end response, and adds just the right amount of timber in its voicing. Compared to our previous manditar models, the newer F-6 and F-12 uses an extended 15\u201d scale allowing for more hand room. Barre chords are even possible near the nut. The Zero Glide nut is very effective at maintaining tuning stability and allows for the lowest possible action alleviating the string tension which is common with short scale instruments. The fretboard is radiused for comfort and the ebony bridge contains a built-in pickup for easy plugged-in playing. Bottom line is this guitar is another voicing to add to your recording studio, band, solo gig, or just to jam with. If you\u2019re looking to achieve a mandolin sound without learning to play the mandolin this does the trick (although, we think you should learn mandolin too)! With the shorter scale length, it lends itself to opening tuning so you can focus more on single or harmonic notes while strumming.

Conventional speaker designs radiate sound in a limited conical pattern similar to a flashlight pattern of directional sound. Low frequency sounds are radiated out but the critical higher frequencies that contribute to voice and music reproduction narrow and beam directly underneath or in front of the speaker. In order hear full range sound over a wider dispersion pattern many more speakers become necessary adding greatly to the cost.

This wide, full range dispersion is created by a precisely engineered design and cohesiveness\\' of the high-performance drivers working in unison to create an omnidirectional in ceiling loudspeaker. The SD Speaker employs (4 smaller 6.5) very fast transient response aluminum-woofer drivers that are very powerful and stable. Working in unison these drivers produce clean powerful dynamic sound. When designing the SD the goal was to have the single most import feature at the forefront, good transient response (\"dynamic contrast\"). A transient is a sound of short duration, and good transient response can only be achieved if the speaker can deliver its output quickly and cleanly without smearing the original sound, and be completely soundless immediately after. Transients contain the essentials of sound reproduction they provide the sharp pop from a snare drum, the cutting edge of digital sound, the dynamics of the human voice.

Circuit components were selected by ear: hand-matched NOS signal capacitors, vintage output transistors, audio-grade resistors, etc.Each Mini K47 is assembled and tested in California.

Every mic undergoes audio sweep testing (20-20kHz swept sine wave) to ensure that it meets our strict performance specifications.The Mini K47 has a durable, heavy steel body. The \"Cutaway\" shockmount has a metal frame, and uses low-resonance O-rings for the suspension.

Types include compound, stereo, or digital. Compound microscopes use a compound optical system with an objective lens and an eyepiece. Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution.

This is a measurement of conductivity and how much signal is loss per foot of wire.

A 3/4-horsepower motor supplies all the power you need for serious stock removal, and the platen has a graphite sheet that helps keep things cool, so you get more life out of both the sander and the belts.\", \"The 9-inch disc sander's table is a generous 7-1/2-by-12-inch cast iron surface, with preset stops at 45 and 90 degrees for reliable angles and nice miter gauge T-slots parallel and perpendicular to the disc. But even better, we think, is the belt sander that operates both horizontally and vertically -- and everywhere in between. The table isn't as large as that of the disc sander, but it's really not necessary, and it functions nicely as a work stop in the horizontal position. The only thing we don't like -- and it's a matter of preference, really -- is that we found the power switch awkward to reach when using the belt sander in the flat position, as it's on the other side of the tool.\", \"Adjustments are all quick and easy, especially changing out the belt. All it takes is a flip of the quick-release belt tension lever, and you'll be back to work in a minute. Tracking is an easy task as well, one we appreciate that Jet made so simple. First, pull up the handle of the tracking lock, then just turn the adjusting knob until the belt is centered on the platen. Lock the handle again, but watch carefully: You may need to fine-tune with the knob again, as the belt tends to shift slightly to the left when the tracking lock is engaged again.

As such, the control system is rather limited, consisting of two buttons and a rocker switch on the back, and a large trigger button on the top. On the back, the menu button doubles as the power button. The power won't turn on or off unless you hold the button for two to three seconds, making it hard to accidentally turn on the phone while it is in your pocket. Upon powering up, you're confronted with the various modes (movie mode, still mode, etc.) for recording or playback. You use the rocker switch to choose between them, and the mode button to switch between the playback and recording menus. Whatever recording mode you're in, the trigger switch at the top starts and stops. In playback modes, you rely heavily on the rocker switch. Depressing the switch performs multiple functions, and makes me wish they'd added another button. The system works well for the most part, however, and is relatively simple.\", \"It's clear that Panasonic intended the user to manage files by using the included software and memory card reader. It is extremely difficult to delete individual files, and to actually playback items is a bit cumbersome, as the SV-AV10 only displays a list of files stored, requiring you to pick blindly (file names are automatically generated, and usually appear similar to this: MOL001.ASF). The only exceptions are the MP3 and AAC files you transfer to the memory card, but those file names are truncated after 17 characters, so you need to be concise.\", 'Movie Mode', 'I\\'ll admit, I was quite excited about the promise of an MPEG-4 in such a small package.
