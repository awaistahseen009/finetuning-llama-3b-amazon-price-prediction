This custom-cover is manufactured specifically for your vehicle to ensure the best protection and fit possible.

This reflective, highly water-resistant coating very effectively shields your vehicle's finish from the damaging effects of the sun, rain, dirt, sap, leaves, bird droppings, acid rain and more. Along with the impressive protection afforded by standard Silverguard, this fabric also includes an ultra-plush, non-abrasive lining to pamper your vehicle's finish. Like all Coverking fabrics, Silverguard Plus is breathable \u2013 this allows moisture which is trapped under the car to escape through the cover, preventing a \u201cgreenhouse\u201d effect and condensation which may result in damage to your finish or a buildup of mildew. It's engineered to let existing moisture out, and keep new moisture from entering. Silverguard Plus is designed for four-season defense against rain, UV rays, tree sap, bird droppings, and more. Besides offering great protection to your finish, vehicle covers also protect the vehicle interior from fading, block prying eyes from seeing what\u2019s inside the car (and acting as a theft deterrent) and help the environment by reducing the need for car washing. Silverguard Plus is a great choice for all-around vehicle protection outside or in your garage.

The floor-standing speaker features a three-way bass-reflex design appropriate for main channels that incorporates a pair of 6-1/4-inch polymer-injected mica diaphragm (PMD) cone woofers, a 5-inch midrange cone driver, and a 1-inch aluminum dome tweeter. For improved imaging, the midrange and tweeter utilize Yamaha's exclusive waveguide horns, which significantly reduce reflected sound and increase the proportion of directly generated sound waves reaching your ears. This compensates for the lack of sound-absorbing materials on the walls of most homes. The result is a clear and precise sense of sound direction and placement that replicates the sound produced in commercial movie theaters.\", 'The NS-555 speaker boasts optimum sound quality by featuring Monster Cable internal wiring among several components, ensuring a clean, clear signal from the crossover network to the speaker driver. To further maintain signal purity, Yamaha provides bi-wiring capability, delivering separate +/- terminals for the woofer(s) and other driver(s). The separation reduces modulation distortion and improves sound quality. In addition, the speaker is magnetically shielded, so you can place it on a TV or video monitor without degrading the picture via stray magnetic fields.', \"The speaker comes with a matching speaker stand that provides the solid footing necessary for full floor contact, enhanced stability, and minimal vibration resonance. The stand is also an attractive complement to the cabinet.

Both superior metal and conductor geometry greatly reduce ear-fatiguing Transient Intermodulation (TIM) Distortion. UNCOMPRESSED HIGH-CURRENT TRANSFER While many AC power cables feature low DC resistance in order to accommodate the demand for high current, a cable\u2019s characteristic impedance is also crucial for optimal performance. Unlike most AC cables that constrict or compress an audio-provoked transient, AudioQuest AC cables combine low DC resistance and ZERO (no) characteristic impedance in order to deliver uncompressed high-current transients on demand. GROUND NOISE-DISSIPATION TECHNOLOGY AC Ground wires provide protection from current-wiring faults, but they also act as antennas. Thus, they are subject to induced radio-frequency (RF) noise. This RF noise bypasses component power supplies and is typically coupled directly into a system\u2019s most sensitive audio/video circuits. AudioQuest\u2019s patented Ground-Noise Dissipation greatly reduces this distortion, yielding unprecedented levels of noise dissipation across the widest bandwidth (range) of radio frequencies possible. DIRECTIONALITY All drawn metal strands or conductors have a non-symmetrical, and therefore directional, grain structure. AudioQuest controls the resulting RF impedance variation so that noise is drained away from where it will cause distortion. When applicable, arrows are clearly marked on the connectors to ensure superior sound quality. For most models of AQ cable, the arrows not only indicate the direction that optimizes metal-directionality as part of Noise-Dissipation, but also indicates non-symmetrical attachment of shield and GND in order to optimize full-system performance.'] ['Perfect-Surface Copper+ (PSC+) & Long-Grain Copper (LGC) Conductors', 'True-Concentric Conductors Minimize Strand Interaction & Magnetic Confusion', 'Ground Noise Dissipation Technology', 'ZERO (No) Characteristic Impedance Enables Uncompressed Current Transfer', 'Directionally Controlled Conductors'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"3 x 3 x 3 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"2 pounds\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"December 5, 2018\", \"Manufacturer\": \"AudioQuest\", \"Color\": \"Blue/Black\", \"Brand\": \"AudioQuest\", \"Connector Gender\": \"Male-to-Female\", \"Input Current\": \"15 Amps\", \"Plug Format\": \"Type B\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Because of the construction of these lenses, it's normally impossible to install filters as there are no filter threads, in addition standard filter sizes are not large enough to adequately cover the lens's wide angle view. The WonderPana FreeArc changes all that by providing a complete kit for mounting our collection of both round and square filters. The all-metal Core attaches directly onto the lens with a secure mounting system. With The Core in place, you can now mount any of Fotodiox's new 'slimline' 145mm round filters. The WonderPana FreeArc system is a perfect fit for panorama, nature, architectural, fashion and event photographers, as well as, analog and digital filmmakers.For even more filter flexibility, mount the WP66 square filter holders (these mount without tools on either side of The Core); once attached the photographer can easily slide in our 6.6\u201d square filters (among the largest and most durable in the business \u2013 they are manufactured by a high-end optics manufacturer). With the FreeArc, the square filter stage is rotatable 360 degrees. The Wonderpana FreeArc can accommodate either two square filters, or one round and one square simultaneously. Fotodiox Pro ND Filters are true neutral density filters designed to darken the image. They features an even, neutral gray color for creative photography applications. The ND16 filter offers a +4 stop EV value which allows you to slow down the shutter speed or use a larger aperture in bright light conditions. The Graduated Neutral Density darkens the sky while leaving the foreground unaffected. These two filters combined are a perfect combination for times when you want to darken the overall scene and darken the sky even more so, such as beach or snow sunsets & sunrises for example.

Pick up our handsaw and hold it in the cutting position. Instantly, you sense that this is the finest cutting instrument of its kind you\\'ve ever held in your hand. Here\\'s why: 1.) Pistol-Grip Handle - Your hand wraps firmly, comfortably, naturally around the contours of the pistol-grip handle. Its made of non-porous (solid - not hollow), virtually indestructible plastic that repels meat acids and stains. Cleans quickly and easily for a more sanitary operation. 2.) Alignment - You note the precision alignment from grip to tip that makes the most exacting cuts smooth, clean and effortless. 3.) Kam-Lok Lever - With a flip of the wrist you unlock the metal \"Flip-lock\" lever, switch blades, and re-lock the lever that always maintains just the right amount of blade tension automatically. 4.) Blades - The blades are superbly engineered and precision manufactured to assure that they meet the same high standards as the frame. Only the hardest spring tempered steel available is used. Teeth are precision ground for maximum sharpness and the set is controlled to exact tolerances for fast, easy cutting. The thin slot of the frame keeps the blade rigid and stable, insuring straight cuts. Hand crafted using the finest materials, the Kam-Lok professional butcher saws have been hand-crafted since 1909 using the finest materials available. They start with high quality stainless steel bar stock, then precision cut, shape and form it into the butcher saw frame. Holes are drilled and the frame is then manually buffed and polished to a reflective finish. Every Kam-Lok lever is individually formed and adjusted before attaching to its frame. The high strength polymer handle is then attached. A quality KASCO blade is then installed and the butcher saw is ready for final inspection, packaging and delivery. Don\\'t settle for less than a Kam-Lok butcher\\'s hand saw...the quality standard for more than 100 years!'] ['Features a metal trigger blade tightener (caoo the Kam-Lok Lever), Stainless Steel frame and a contoured ABS Solid plastic grip handle. The Weston Brand Butcher Saws have a plastic trigger lock (trigger blade tightener). Cheap Bone Saws have a hollow plastic handle that breaks VERY easily when dropped. Easily lasts a lifetime. The blade will NOT bend when cutting and is very taut - not flimsy like the much cheaper meat saws.', 'Comes with 1 saw blade installed. And 1 extra saw blade FREE! Always face teeth toward front of meat hand saw - just the opposite of a wood saw. Pin to pin measurement on blade is 25 Inches. Overall length of blade is 25.5 inches. Many cheap Butcher Hand Saws will have a variance of up to 1/4 inch - which makes the blade wobbley and unstable - and almost impossible to cut meat with.', \"If you are planning to process beefs or hogs - you Definitely NEED this Meat Handsaw! This Butcher Saw should last for decades - we've been using the same Bone Saw here at our meat processing plant for the last 14 years. We have tried some of the other cheap meat handsaws in the past. None have compared to the KASCO Meat Handsaw.\", 'Includes an extra blade FREE! Total of 2 blades included with your 25 Inch Meat Handsaw. Replacement blades available from Ask The Meatman at Amazon at a very affordable cost. The blade has 11 teeth per inch.', 'Overall Dimensions Of Meat Hand Saw: 31\" Long by 7 Inches Wide by .75 Inch Deep. Weight: 2.87 lbs. This is NOT a LITTLE Butcher Saw. It is over 2 and half feet long and weighs almost 3 lbs. This is a Commercial Grade Meat Handsaw meant to last for YEARS so it heavier than the cheap Meat Hand Saws that you usually find on the internet. Don\\'t be fooled by \"cheap\" meat handsaws!

The result is a clean edge along a highlight, with minimal aberrations and distractions, that is especially pleasing when it is out of focus. This means there is no comparison to the results of XF56mmF1.2 R WR when it is used wide open.

Bimetal blades are welded by an electron beam under high vacuum to attach the strip of high speed M2 teeth to the spring steel back. The teeth are then ground into the M2 steel. The variable pitch combines regular teeth of different pitches, gullet depths, and set angles. Variable pitch gives smoother cuts, faster sawing, improved chip clearance, and longer blade life. A win all around. With this, noise and chatter are greatly reduced while cutting. Variable pitch blades can handle solid cutting as well as interrupted cutting such as tubing, etc. Bimetal blades will give lower cost for you per cut on tough sawing jobs. These are primarily used for steel sawing, but also can be used for sawing non-ferrous materials and wood.

Once configured, the system allows independent control of up to eight groups of fixtures (four accessible via a Shift key), with 37 backlit silicone buttons and four rotary encoders allowing three different FX engines (Color, Move and Beam) to be easily triggered and customized independently for each group. The controller also features separate dedicated buttons for Strobe, Blinder, Speed, Blackout and Smoke. The WMX1 features four DMX universes and four output sockets (two 5-pin and two 3-pin) with the ability to map any universe to any output, allowing the unit to also serve as a DMX splitter. Out of the box the system supports a single DMX universe (output via all four sockets), while three additional universes are available as upgrades through the WTOOLS app. It also features both an internal microphone and 3.5mm jack line input socket for automated BPM detection, as well as a button that allows the BPM to be \u2018tapped in\u2019 manually. A Color Picker interface on the screen, which allows easy selection of just the right hue, can be used both for RGBW and RGBWA+UV LED fixtures. Other useful features include automatic matching of similar GOBOs across different fixture types, Fixture FLIP function (for reversing beam order), Fixture SPLIT function (for splitting up multi-FX bars) and Auto-recovery of the active project (no manual saving needed). Despite its low weight (2.36lb / 1070g) and compact dimensions (7.68\u201d x 8.66\u201d x 2.44\u201d / 195 x 220 x 62mm [LxWxH]), the WMX1 is extremely robust. Inside its tough ABS plastic shell, the unit features a powder-coated steel base plate and reinforced back plate. Its 220Mhz CPU with ARM core and 8MB RAM / 16MB flash memory allow for extremely complex effects to be layered and run independently across multiple groups all in real time.'] ['Setup Standalone (no computer needed) Compatible with any DMX device Standard unit comes with 1 DMX universe but up to 3 additional universes are available as add-ons, which are sold via the WTOOLS app. Up to 680 fixtures & beams Up to 50 fixture types Up to 5000 fixture features (color/gobo etc...) 8 fixture groups 6 projects 15000+ available fixtures (3500+ on the controller) DMX address, fixture order & group setup Use as a DMX splitter with DMX universe mapping', 'Palettes & FX Color FX module with 8 effect types & 16 definable colors Move FX module with 8 effect types Beam FX module with 8 effect types 6 Flash buttons for controlling Special FX, Strobe, Blinder, Speed, Blackout & Smoke Static color palette with 10 user definable colors per group & gradient control Static position palette with 5 user definable positions per group with fade & fanning Gobo palette with 5 user definable gobos per group 20 namable live edit buttons with flash triggering mode and \u2018Park\u2019 function 100 namable presets for storing snapshots with hold and fade timings Preset playback cue list- all presets or per page of 20 presets', 'Control & Sync Group and master dimming with encoder acceleration Group FLASH, FULL and Blackout 16 bit Pan/Tilt control Multi-beam L"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}
