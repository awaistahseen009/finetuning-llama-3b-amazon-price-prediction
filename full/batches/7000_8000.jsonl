ApplicationActive Recording / Mixdown Monitors Engineering ObjectiveThe Avantone Active Mixcubes are designed to be high-resolution, full-range powered mini-reference monitors for fixed or remote locations.The secondary engineering facet was to create a timeless design that compliments a single full-range transducer. Performance ObjectiveStudios primarily use 2-way & 3-way larger monitors designed to represent a wide range reference viewpoint at higher listening levels. However, in this newly developing age of High Definition Audio, there is still a need to also hear what your mix will sound like when played back over small \u201cbass-challenged\u201d systems such as televisions, clock radios, computers, car stereos, iPod docking stations, etc. It is important to make mixing judgments based partially on listening to reference monitors that will not impart tonal anomalies caused by crossovers or inferior full range drivers. Particular attention is always paid to the critical mid-range vocal/guitar/keyboard areas. This is where having a full-range monitor without a crossover is truly revealing. Ten months of R&D comparative listening & tweaking went into the voicing of the MixCubes. The result is a very smooth sounding, full range upgrade from the original 5C Sound Cubes. Listening tests reveal that the MixCubes have a smooth, more open, transparent top end response with extended bass while maintaining their basic original character. Cabinet DesignThe original 5C Sound Cubes were made of \u00bd\u201d particleboard covered with a glue-on wood grain contact paper. We chose to use thicker, denser MDF board because of its high rigidity and inherent low-resonance characteristics. We started with a 165mm (6 1/2\") sealed cube design with radiused edges.'] {\"Package Dimensions\": \"18 x 15 x 12 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"29.9 pounds\", \"Date First Available\": \"April 21, 2018\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Avantone\", \"Speakers Maximum Output Power\": \"600 Watts\", \"Brand\": \"Avantone\", \"Model Name\": \"Active\", \"Speaker Type\": \"Monitor\", \"Mounting Type\": \"Tabletop\", \"Surround Sound Channel Configuration\": \"3.0\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The New Mast-R-Lift II adheres to those strong principles. The Mast-R-Lift II has 5 double sealed bearings, providing a lifetime of use even with the heaviest of routers. All of JessEm's lifts have the patented feature of adding tension to the threaded spindle to remove backlash, vibration, and preventing setting changes while routing. JessEm went one step further with the Mast-R-Lift II. A new dedicated locking mechanism for heavy duty, long term routing operations was added, accessible from the top of the top surface and is engaged with the same crank handle used to raise and lower the Lift. The Mast-R-Lift II also fits most fixed base routers on the market today without the use of an adaptor collar. The unique clamping blocks on the Mast-R-Lift II enable users to use different fixed base routers with the Lift as opposed to dedicating a router. All of our top plates on our Lifts are hard anodized. This process is several times more expensive but we want the Mast-R-Lift II to provide many years of service. Hard anodizing is an engineered surface treatment and not just a cosmetic sulphuric treatment that will wear off. The shafts on the Mast-R-Lift II, like all of JessEm's Lifts are pressed into a shaft mount with hydraulic pressure. We don't just thread our shafts to the top plate. By pressing the shafts into a larger diameter mount we are able to attach the shafts to the top plate and fasten in place with more than just one screw spreading the lateral load and providing a very rigid and durable mount that will withstand the toughest routing operations. The Mast-R-Lift II provides for above the table bit changes for all routers without the need for bent wrenches. All the machined components are machined on one of our CNC machining centers in Barrie, Ontario Canada, and all the aluminum non wear components are anodized for appearance, corrosion resistance and some wear resistance.\", 'From the Manufacturer', \"JessEm sets pretty high standards when we develop a new tool.

Many things have changed in the last 25 years; most notably, in the past most houses had a bathroom with a standard shower and a sink. Today many homeowners and builders are upgrading the bathrooms with new things like body sprayers and multiple showerheads. Also additions like whirlpool tubs have become standard in new constructions as opposed to an expensive remodeling a few years ago. That is the main reason for the need for a bigger capacity tankless water heater development, another reason for a bigger unit is the cold temperatures in northern states where a higher rise in temperature is needed to heat the water instantly. We spent a lot of time talking with our distributors, installers, and customers directly, getting their feedback of what they were looking for. After two years of development and testing, we are proud to say that have achieved a state of the art heater and the newest member of the Niagara Industries family the TITAN-SCR4. Available in three models, the new TITAN-SCR4 comes in 18 KW, and 21 KW; which is ideal for a wide range of applications including residential and some commercial applications. One TITAN-SCR4 unit can supply all the hot water needed and in some applications, energy savings can pay back the unit cost in one year. The TITAN-SCR4 tankless water heater comes with a 10 year warranty on all water carrying components and all other parts are guarantied for one year. Installation is quick and easy requiring no venting, and the TITAN-SCR4 compact size allows installation almost anywhere. The TITAN-SCR4 is without a doubt the tankless water heater of the future.

Like the name implies, it\\'s a SilverCone two-way system with a 5\" woofer and with an extended bass frequency response and astounding output level, the SC205 will easily fill your room with exceptional sound. The SC205 also comes with the convenience of threaded screw inserts on the bottom and the back. That way, you can mount your SC205 on a regular microphone or speaker stand, or use the back plate for different wall mounting options available on the market. Tech TalkThe SC205 uses a 5\" SilverCone woofer for an extended bass response. This very stiff diaphragm is honeycomb structured and glass fibre coated. Like in other models, it\\'s driven by a sophisticated magnet system that uses a 1\" voice coil responsible for delivering a greater linear excursion. All in all, this produces a bigger dynamic range than you would naturally assume from a speaker of these proportions. The result is an unsurpassed audio transparency that, when coupled with the proprietary AMT tweeter and PWM amplifier, will surprise you with a very powerful and precise low end. The AMT (Air Motion Transformer) tweeter is an EVE proprietary technology that follows the rule of not using \"off-the-shelf\" components when looking for the best possible results. The preciseness and detail in the high frequency, along with the general tightness of the bass and mid-range frequencies, will make the SC205 equally adequate for use on the road or in studio. DSPWith every EVE Audio speaker, you also get high resolution DSP electronics. One push knob operation and you will have access to accurate volume control and several different filter settings that will help you tailor your monitors to the way you work. And if you always avoid digital processing, we\\'ve got you covered.

THE PROP: Purchased as a harmless gift, this cane ultimately becomes the instrument of Larry Talbot's destruction. Multiple props were created for the production of 1941's The Wolfman by noted prop-maker Ellis Burman Sr., a functional hero prop and stunt props which were cast in rubber for actor safety. The wolf head design was based on and hand-sculpted over an existing boar head cane, a popular motif on traditional walking canes. THE : Today, only a single rubber stunt cane head survives in the personal archive of collector extraordinaire Bob Burns, and the replica previously produced by us in 2013 was based on that piece. However, our team was recently provided with access to never-before-seen vintage reference photography of the hero prop, which allowed us to create a new, highly-detailed 3D model, from which we have recreated the hero prop as it appears when first seen in the Conliffe Antique Shop. Not only is this edition of the cane more accurate to the hero prop, it now features an upgraded all metal handle construction and a solid acacia wood shaft.\"] [\"A highly collectible prop replica of Larry Talbot's Cane from 1941's, The Wolfman\", 'Our team was recently provided with access to never-before-seen vintage reference photography of the hero prop, which allowed us to create a new, highly-detailed 3D model', 'Features an upgraded all metal handle construction and a solid acacia wood shaft', 'The wolf head design was based on and hand-sculpted over an existing boar head cane, a popular motif on traditional walking canes', 'Another amazing prop replica piece from Factory Entertainment - Made for fans, by fans!'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"43 x 16 x 9 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"6.19 pounds\", \"Manufacturer recommended age\": \"18 years and up\", \"Release date\": \"February 21, 2022\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Factory Entertainment\", \"Brand\": \"Factory Entertainment\", \"Publication Date\": \"February 21, 2022\", \"Genre\": \"Horror\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The last top left spinning is the victor. The main premise of the Beyblade series is customizable, with interchangeable parts. Both the toys and their name were inspired by \"Beigoma\", a traditional spinning top. The introduction of the toy corresponded with the broadcast of the Beyblade anime television series of the same name. In 2001, the series was licensed by Korean toy maker Sonokong. In 2002, Hasbro began to sell Beyblade toys internationally (under license from, and produced by, Takara) along with a coordinated country-by-country release of localized versions of the TV series.

Adjust your ladder to meet the needs of your project, so you can work more efficiently than ever. This tough-as-nails ladder is equipped with a variety of features that set this ladder apart from the rest. - Multi-Position Ladder- This multi-position ladder converts to multiple configurations with the press of a button. Seamlessly set up the Epic as a stepladder, extension ladder, 90-degree ladder, staircase ladder, or trestle-and-plank scaffolding. Whether you use it in the home or on the job, the Epic is durable and versatile enough to meet the task. - Safety Rails - This ladder features extendable safety rails that can be placed vertically or horizontally on the ladder. When placed vertically in the walkthrough position, the rails extend above the top of the ladder, giving you a sturdy handhold. This feature is ideal when climbing to the roof of the house because it gives you a stabilizing surface to move from the ladder to the roof with ease and back down again. Additionally, the non-marring safety rails can be placed horizontally in the standoff position, so you can set up your ladder around windows, spanning a distance of up to 7 feet. In its horizontal stand off position, you can place hanging hooks on the rails, where you can hang items up to 15 lbs., like paint buckets, water or other supplies that you would like to have within arm\u2019s reach. - Other benefits - Other benefits of the ladder include Tip & Glide wheels that improve ladder mobility during transportation. It is uncommon to work on a perfectly level surface, and with the Rachet leg levelers, you can easily adjust your ladder to safely meet any uneven ground with ease. Integrated dual-position accessory ports connect to the Little Giant AirDeck. The dual-position feature allows you to use certain accessories vertically or horizontally.

Nikon's Silent Wave Motor (SWM) autofocus mechanism provides near-silent auto focusing that is both fast and accurate. Combined with Vibration Reduction (VR) image stabilization, the SWM AF system equips the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-140mm for handheld video recording as well as fast-action photography. Additionally, manual autofocus override allows instant switching to manual focus without taking your eye off the subject.
