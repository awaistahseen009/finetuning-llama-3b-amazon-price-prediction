Observations during twilight and at night require larger optics to collect as much light as possible, but big lenses alone are not enough to ensure a superior viewing experience. It also takes quality glass and rugged construction to keep your binoculars safe and working well for years to come. Celestron\u2019s large-aperture Echelon series binoculars were designed for use in low light conditions. Whether you are long-range glassing across a field or valley, or gazing at the splendors of the Milky Way, a pair of Celestron Echelon binoculars will get the job done. With an exit pupil of 3.5 mm, these binoculars deliver an amazing amount of light allowing you to see the most detail possible. The Echelon 20x70 model offers the highest magnification in the Echelon Series. Choose this model for picking out small subjects at the longest distances, or for high-magnification viewing of celestial objects. Superb Optical Quality - Celestron Echelon binoculars sport high quality 70 mm objective lenses made in Japan. Superior BaK-4 prisms were chosen for maximum contrast and sharpness, and all air-to-glass surfaces are multi-coated with Celestron\u2019s proprietary XLT optical coatings\u2014the same high transmission coatings used on our observatory-grade telescopes to increase contrast and resolution. Assembled in the USA - Celestron Echelon binoculars are manufactured using quality Japanese optics and are assembled by hand by skilled technicians in Southern California. Quality Construction - Each Echelon binocular housing is made of aluminum alloy, to keep them strong yet lightweight, an important factor when considering a big binocular purchase. Durable rubber armor covers the aluminum housing for a slip-free grip and protection against the occasional bump or ding. These binoculars are fully waterproof and are nitrogen-purged to seal the optics against fog, dew, and other forms of moisture. This means you can use your Echelon binocular in damp conditions without having to pack up and call it a day when unexpected weather makes an appearance. Includes Waterproof Hard Case - Echelon binoculars come with a high quality waterproof hard case for ultimate protection against dust, moisture, and rough handling. A molded foam insert cradles the binoculars perfectly, keeping them safe and sound no matter where your journeys take you! Individual Focus - Echelon binoculars use an individual eye focus system, enabling you to rotate each eyepiece to set the proper focus for your right and left eye. Once set, you should be able to use your binoculars at a moment\u2019s notice and focus sharply at infinity, the normal distance desired for long-range observations. Should you wish to share your binocular with others, it is fast and simple to adjust the focus for their vision requirements. Extended Eye Relief - The Celestron 20x70 Echelon Binoculars have 19.5 mm of eye relief, maki [' LONG-RANGE AND : Enjoy low-light and astronomical observing with these large aperture 70mm binoculars.

If you don't have an IPCamPower POE Spot Monitor, then you've already chosen the hard way.\", \"Setting up a spot monitor typically requires you to run an HDMI or VGA cable from your NVR to your monitor. In most cases, this means that your NVR will need to be near the spot monitor, as you'll start to see video degradation with longer HDMI cable runs. You could also buy another secondary NVR and another monitor that is in addition to your main NVR for the sole purpose of using it as a spot monitor, but that can be expensive, convoluted, and messy!\", \"You'll also need to have a nearby power source for both your NVR and spot monitor, which depending on your setup, may require you to hire an electrician to run power to your monitor's location. Ultimately, this setup is not always feasible and may leave your NVR vulnerable if it's publicly accessible near the spot monitor. That's where IPCamPower's PoE powered spot monitor comes into play!\", \"The IPCamPower POE Spot Monitor has its' own integrated 8-channel video decoder built directly into the monitor.

The hall mode will feature a classic reverb sound that can move your signal from a small-room-echo to a haunting long hall- echo. The reverse mode smoothly flips your signal to playback unique responses and can be manipulated with pre-delay time controls. Shimmer mode highlights the octave features, dry signal, -1, and +1 to mix in your signal and creates a symphony of sound.

['Completely Prevent Record Wear New records treated with LAST Record Preservative and kept clean can be played 100s of times without discernible wear--allowing them to be in pristine condition for future generations. The 30-second treatment affects the vinyl to a depth of about ten molecular layers and becomes part of the grove wall. There are no surface residues that can be picked up by the stylus. In fact overuse is harmless. Greg Weaver August 1999 Soundstage Magazine: \"As to the preservation capabilities of the Record Preservative I can only speculate as I have no microscopes to examine the grooves of my records. But sonically it seems to offer much the same type of improvement as the Stylus Treatment but more of it. Midrange voices seem more pure and have more body; they are more truthful to the original voice and offer greater detail. Focus is a good bit sharper and with more detail uncovered especially near the noise floor. Again the microdynamic nature of the music is improved as are the separation and delineation of objects throughout the soundstage. Surface noise is again greatly reduced much more so here than with the Stylus Treatment alone. This stuff is smooth! The winning combination here is the use of a record treated with the Preservative tracked by a stylus treated with the Treatment. The combined enhancement of the two products on the sonic performance is quite desirable. And given that they are both purported to extend the life of both stylus and record what\\'s not to like?\" The recorded sights and sounds of the world are an important part of our cultural heritage -- they will survive only as long as the media lasts.

The reversed lens turret maximizes the stage's working space. The microscope is perfect for classroom workstations or labs with limited space. To customize the microscope to your viewing comfort, the eyepiece spacing can be easily adjusted using a precision Siedentopf mechanism. A diopter is available on the left ocular tube to compensate for asymmetry, and the ocular tubes are angled at 30\u00c2\u00b0 to comfortably accommodate a seated position without neck strain. The head can also be rotated 360\u00c2\u00b0 to accommodate multiple users. Various eyepieces can be used to increase the overall optical magnification. The trinocular photo-port adds a dedicated mounting tube for cameras. The 23mm tube is height-adjustable to fine-tune the focus to match the eyepieces. The 2-layer mechanical stage provides smooth and precise movement for examination of specimen slides. The stage's low-position controls are conveniently placed near the coaxial focus knobs for a streamlined workflow. Examining specimen slides is intuitive and precise for users at any skill level.

In addition to the mic Press, there are eight channels of D-A conversion providing eight analog outputs. The eight mic Press feature automatic mic/line switching inputs and two front-panel instrument inputs. Designed specifically for the Clarett range, they offer plenty of gain, yet low noise and distortion - and great sound quality. They also include a special \u201cAir\u201d feature that switches in an analog model of the classic transformer-based Focus rite ISA mic pre, switching the impedance of the preamp to that of the original ISA and enabling a \u2018transformer resonance effect\u2019, giving microphone sources the air and clarity of an ISA transformer-based mic pre recording. In addition, the mic Press have plenty of headroom and are ideal for recording drums and other extreme level sources. The front panel instrument inputs feature extra headroom to handle high-output pickups, while the rear panel includes universal XLR/jack connectors for the remaining auto-switching mic/line inputs. In addition, each input has its own switched insertion point for single-cable connection of compression, equalization and other outboard analog processing - with hard-wired relay bypass, so you can leave outboard gear or a patch bay connected ready to access at the Press of a button. The inputs drive eight channels of precision 24-bit Focus rite A-D with 118dB dynamic range and standard sample rates up to 192kHz. Clarett OctoPre also offers D-A conversion (from the ADAT inputs, with 119dB dynamic range) of up to eight channels, making it perfect for mixing as well as tracking. The line outputs can optionally provide line level output feeds from the mic Press - useful for feeding a live console while recording the digital outputs.

This is a complete system with the subwoofer enclosed in a box along with a built-in amplifier. This system will give you more bass in your car or truck, without giving up tons of space. This subwoofer has a tight suspension and it produces a super clean and controlled bass response that sounds incredible. Installation is quick and easy since this is an all in one system. High level and low level inputs allow you to wire this system to the RCA output of an aftermarket radio or to the high level inputs of a stock radio. Our engineers used sophisticated computer modeling and created a ported enclosure for a 10\" woofer that sounds better than most 12\u201d subs. Turbo tuned with an aerostyle port you will be astounded at the bass output this little bass enclosure produces. We are talking about low bass frequencies that you can feel. In most cases packaged systems put out weak bass that is not deep. Our Rockville subwoofer was engineered and tuned to put out punchy bass. Powered by a powerful built in Class AB 300 Watt RMS amplifier the RVB10. 1A will keep you rocking with clean power. We also eliminated air or mechanical noise that you do not want to hear. This system features an electronic low pass crossover that is fully adjustable so that you can customize it for your car\\'s listening environment.

(Years later, taxation implemented through the mandatory purchase of stamps was an issue that helped to spark the American Revolution.) The tax was repealed a year later, and very few were ever actually used in the thirteen colonies, but they saw service in Canada and the British Caribbean islands.[5] In the years leading up to the American Revolution mail routes among the colonies existed along the few roads between Boston, New York and Philadelphia. In the middle 18th century, individuals like Benjamin Franklin and William Goddard were the colonial postmasters who managed the mails then and were the general architects of a postal system that started out as an alternative to the Crown Post (the colonial mail system then) which was now becoming more distrusted as the American Revolution drew near.[citation needed] The postal system that Franklin and Goddard forged out of the American Revolution became the standard for the new U.S. Post Office and is a system whose basic designs are still used in the United States Postal Service today.'] {\"Package Dimensions\": \"6.7 x 3 x 0.9 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"3.2 ounces\", \"Manufacturer recommended age\": \"11 years and up\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Captain Nikkiesavage\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

This musical instrument translated movements of the hands around an Antenna into vibrant tones. The Theremin lamp does the same with light: its light Antenna shines light to wherever you hold your hand, giving maximum freedom to create light settings that fit your own needs and wishes best. The magic of the Theremin lies within its gesture control feature. With the wave of a hand, the light shines to wherever you direct it. \"With the Theremin, you simply place your hands where you want the light to go.

The QuickSAM system is a unique, integrated mounting bracket which is virtually foolproof. It allows the installer to simply snap the speaker onto the bracket, then tighten it to the desired position. For array mounting, there is an optional array bracket kit available which allows multiple units to be mounted together for a variety of configurations.All Zx1i \"t\" versions use a special circuit that, when in transformer mode, re-configures the network to a current actuated Hi-Pass filter at the transformer primary. It gently rolls off the lowest frequencies to maintain a safe load on the amplifier without affecting the higher (vocal) frequencies and the program continues without interruption. Low frequency current is limited through the transformer eliminating low frequency saturation. Automatic Saturation Compensation allows many speakers to be run on a distributed line with a 50Hz Hi-Pass filter before the amplifier, regardless of the number of speakers on the same line (the number of tapped watts cannot exceed the amplifier rating).

In Multi-Pattern Mode, the LCT 640 TS has all the well-known characteristics of a classic multi-pattern condenser mic. In order to make it easier to play around with different polar patterns, Lewitt created the Polarizer plug-in (compatible with PC and MAC, available as VST, AU and AAX plugin). Using the Polarizer, polar patterns can be set and fine-tuned by simply using a slider bar. Usually, mid side stereophony can only be done with two microphones. But now, it is way easier to use one LCT 640 TS. Just point the side of the microphone to the signal source and record both outputs on a stereo track in your DAW. Change the panorama for both signals to adjust the stereo width. Plug in one 3-pin XLR and you have a large diaphragm multi-pattern condenser mic featuring the following polar patterns: Omni, wide cardioid, cardioid, supercardioid and figure-8.

The third brake light is 2-inches tall and stretches across the middle of the unit. The reverse light is helpful for backing up and illuminates the camera\u2019s viewing angle in low light situations. A removable rubber cap with a debossed Alpine logo covers the wheel lock in the center of the unit. The HCE-TCAM1-WRA\u2019s rear view camera is waterproof and dust proof, so it\u2019s ready for off-road challenges like heavy dust and water crossings. The HCE-TCAM1-WRA attaches to the Wrangler\u2019s spare tire mount and is fixed using the OEM lug nut or an optional aftermarket wheel lock. It is compatible with most factory and aftermarket wheels and comes with three mounting posts of varying lengths, so you can choose a post that fits the depth of your spare wheel. The HCE-TCAM1-WRA projects a color rear view image onto the in-dash screen.

Not only that, but it's inherently water-resistant - no coatings or laminates - so even after 2-3 years, it repels water as good as new. This magnificent material is the culmination of decades of materials engineering initiative. Like all Coverking fabrics, Stormproof is breathable \u2013 this allows moisture which is trapped under the car to escape through the cover, preventing a \u201cgreenhouse\u201d effect and condensation which may result in damage to your finish or a buildup of mildew. It's engineered to let existing moisture out, and keep new moisture from entering. Stormproof is designed for four-season defense against rain, UV rays, tree sap, bird droppings, and more. Besides offering great protection to your finish, vehicle covers also protect the vehicle interior from fading, block prying eyes from seeing what\u2019s inside the car (and acting as a theft deterrent) and help the environment by reducing the need for car washing. Stormproof is a great choice for all-around vehicle protection outside or in your garage.

One of Coverking's pattern designers spent time with your model vehicle and used 3D scanners and special software to record every compound curve and detail. That data is then used to create a world-class cover with the fewest seams possible. Seams are inherently the weakest area of any sewn product, so Coverking also overlaps and double-stitches all seams with heavy, wax-coated thread. The thin coating of wax helps to seal the fabric where the needle pierced through, reducing the chance of leakage through the seam. Custom mirror and antenna pockets are sewn in to allow the cover to rest snuggly on your vehicle's exterior. This reduces flapping in the wind and movement which, over time, can damage your finish.

The DMC-LX2 inherits the f2.8 28mm wide angle Leica DC lens, 4x optical zoom (equivalent to 28-112mm on a 35mm film camera), and Mega O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) system in addition to an enhanced CCD capable of taking images at 10.2-megapixel resolution, as well a larger, 2.8-inch 16:9 wide LCD.', 'The DMC-LX2 is unique in that it incorporates three \"wide\" features: a 28mm wide-angle Leica DC lens, 16:9 wide CCD, and 16:9 wide LCD. Not only that, the LX2 is further distinguished from other cameras by its full manual controllability with a joystick allowing users to easily enjoy creative shooting. The DMC-LX2 also boasts a Venus Engine III high-performance image-processing LSI to dramatically reduce the noise that challenged the predecessor, realizing image recording at maximum ISO 1600 high sensitivity setting at full resolution.', \"To fight against the major cause of blurred images, Panasonic invented the Mega O.I.S. system, taking advantage of its superior lens technology to compensate for handshake. In addition, to also compensate for the other major cause of blurred images--movement of the subject--the LX2 is also equipped with the world's first Intelligent ISO Control (hereafter I.I.C.) and high-sensitivity recording capabilities, up to a maximum ISO of 1600, within the advanced image processing LSI Venus Engine III. When set to the I.I.C., the Venus Engine III detects the subject's movement and adjusts the ISO setting and shutter speed to best suit the subject movement and the light condition automatically. Panasonic's excellent image stabilizing system allows users to take clear, crisp images in any situation, leaving everything to the camera.\", 'The Lumix LX series are distinct from other compact cameras in the way they feature extensive manual controls including manual focus and manual exposure which can be smoothly operated with a joystick. This joystick further provides operation shortcuts to the frequently used settings including white balance, ISO, image size, compression format, light metering, and AF mode by simply pressing and holding it. It also allows exposure compensation and selection of one out of nine focusing areas.', \"The aspect ratio is easily selectable between 16:9 wide, 3:2, and conventional 4:3 with a switch located on top of the lens barrel to shoot in the framing aspect that best suits the subjects' composition or image's purpose of use.\", 'In addition, the DMC-LX2 is capable of recording wide 16:9 high definition (1280 x 720) motion image at 15 frames per second (fps).', \"Other features that elevate the DMC-LX2 are the incorporation of 13MB of built-in memory and the battery life that has been extended to up to 300 pictures on one charging (CIPA standard), so you won't miss those great spur-of-the-moment shots.
