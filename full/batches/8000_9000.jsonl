Compact floorstanders for stereo and surround Emit 30 is perfect for larger stereo systems or compact multi-channel home cinema set-ups in medium to large rooms.

Emit 30 is a compact two-and-a-half-way speaker designed to impress whether its used as a stand-alone stereo pair or as part of a 5.1-channel (or more) home cinema. Like its little brother Emit 10 it uses 14cm MSP woofers similar to those used in the Evoke series this time doubled-up in each speaker for more low-frequency muscle plus midrange clarity and punch. MSP stands for Magnesium Silicate Polymer. Its a material developed in-house for woofer cones and have been used for decades including on the most-lauded high-end models. MSP provides precisely the right combination of lightness stiffness and damping to deliver control and outright power exactly where its needed. Premium woofer technology The cones are molded in one piece; a separate glued dust cap is not used. The little balance ribs around the edge of the center are bonded directly to the voice-coil behind it making the whole motor assembly one solid piece. Using fewer moving parts gives the engineers fine control over how the speaker moves which in turn means fine control over how it performs. Youll hear it as strong tight bass and startlingly clear vocals guitars and more. Even at eyebrow-raising volume. Each woofer is powered by a dual-stacked strontium carbonite Ferrite+ ceramic magnet system. Using two magnets means more effectively directing where the magnetic energy goes its a lesson learned when developing the award-winning Special Forty anniversary series.

The 50mm focal length allows you to fill the frame with your subject from a comfortable distance making it a great lens for portraits. A similar perspective to the human eye and its compact size make the EF 50mm f/1.8 STM a great everyday lens to always carry with your EOS camera. The near-silent STM (Stepping Motor) technology focuses extremely quickly when shooting photos, so you can react suddenly to capture fleeting moments.

The combo kit features DeWalt's popular line of 18-volt cordless tools and accessories, including a heavy-duty, three-speed clutch drill/driver/hammer drill; a sturdy reciprocating saw with keyless blade clamp; a 6-1/2-inch circular saw; a jig saw; and a flexible floodlight, along with accessories suited for each. The drill/driver/hammer drill boasts a DeWalt-built high-torque motor (450 in./lbs. of maximum torque) for drilling bigger holes and driving bigger screws. This unit also features a unique three-speed transmission that produces a greater range of rpm for noticeably faster drilling and driving applications. When hammer-drilling into masonry, the maximum speed setting drills holes up to 33 percent faster, at a top speed of 34,000 beats per minute. The DW938 reciprocating saw features a keyless lever-action blade change and packs the power to handle the toughest demolition jobs. You'll especially appreciate the tool's cordless feature when working in confined spaces. The DW939 6-1/2-inch saw is equally powerful, with a left-side blade for easy right-handed visibility. The DW933 jig saw's counterbalance makes it a pleasure to use, while the four-position orbital action lets you dial in the blade speed that best matches each application. The DW919 floodlight lights up a work site's nooks and crannies, and features a flexible neck you can use to wrap it around a stud or rafter. These tools are being sold as an all-in-one set at a price significantly lower than the sum of each tool priced individually.

This lens offers an f/2.8 maximum aperture throughout the entire zoom range, to ensure stress-free photographic shots at all focal lengths and distances. Additionally, a broader photographic expression through the use of faster shutter speeds as a result of the maximum aperture offers enhanced photographic pleasure. Features: Optimized for Digital SLR - The use of XR (Extra Refractive Index) glass optimizes the overall distribution of optical power, and also reduces various aberrations to the absolute minimum while achieving remarkable compactness. In addition, suitable positioning of two hybrid aspherical elements serves to maintain imaging performance and to shorten and compress the entire optical system.LD Glass - An LD (Low Dispersion) glass element is used to accomplish effective compensation of on-axis and lateral chromatic aberrations, a critical factor for enhancing optical quality in digital photography, in order to achieve outstanding optical performance over the entire zoom range.Enhanced Peripheral Illumination - Peripheral light fall-off is minimized when compared with that of conventional lenses for film cameras, so images are uniformly bright from the center to the periphery.Internal Surface Coating to Reduce Ghosting and Flare - By employing \"Internal Surface Coatings\" (i.e., multiple-layer coatings on cemented surfaces of plural elements) and multiple-layer coating technology on ordinary elements, ghosting and flare due to the reflections that occur when light enters through the front element and reflections caused by the imagers'] ['This Certified Refurbished product is tested and certified to look and work like new.

When water is drawn from the tank, the pressure inside the tank decreases until the pressure switch starts the pump. The amount of usable water for every pump cycles is called drawdown. The greater drawn-down capacity you select, the less your pump cycles saving energy, money, and extending your pump life. Advantages over galvanized well tanks: Pre-charged tanks do not have water-logging problems like the galvanized tanks. The air and water are totally separated using a diaphragm. No external air controls needed. Pre-charged tanks have a much larger draw-down for the same physical size. Larger draw down reduces pump cycles and pump wear, i.e. at 30/50 PSIG range three times the draw-down for pre-charged tanks of the same physical size. Pre-charged Tanks completely empty during each pump cycle. Pre-charged Tanks are much smaller and easier to handle that galvanized well tanks. Pre-charged tanks with a 30/50 Pressure Switch would be one-third the size of a galvanized tank with the same drawdown. Deep Well Jet Pumps could use either a vertical tank or a horizontal tank, depending on space requirements and sizing. Submersible Pump applications would usually use vertical tanks, again based on proper sizing. Shallow Well Jet Pumps could use vertical or horizontal tanks, based on proper sizing. The rule of thumb in sizing is to count the number of fixtures in the home, i.e. sinks, showers, toilets, dishwasher, faucets, washing machines, outside faucets, etc. and multiply it by 3. Example: a house with 11 fixtures x 3 would be 33-Gallon tank.

The other stick is much thinner and flexible and used to play the higher note end of the drum. The drum is slung over the neck of the player with a strap usually made up of ropes or woven cloth.

The housing offers an unobstructed view of the camera's information and control functions and operates safely to a depth of 200'. Camera installation is quick and simple, and the O-ring seal can be checked visually through the clear housing. The housing is sized and weighted for near-neutral buoyancy and superb handling underwater. A flash diffuser is included to improve lighting quality when the camera's built-in flash is used underwater. For optimum lighting underwater an optional external strobe is recommended. Ikelite strobes are brighter, recycle faster and offer wider coverage than the camera's flash. Being farther from the camera lens, the strobe reduces the illumination of particles in the water which helps eliminate backscatter. The housing comes standard with an optical-grade glass flat port which allows full use of the camera's zoom without vignetting. The Canon PowerShot SX210 IS features a 28mm wide-angle setting. External wide-angle conversion lenses cannot be used to any advantage. For wide-angle work the housing does accept the Ikelite WD-4 Wide-Angle Conversion Dome Port. The conversion dome corrects for the refractive magnification of the flat port underwater to restore the camera's original angle of coverage. The WD-4 and Canon PowerShot SX210 IS combination provides a 28mm angle of coverage with incredibly crisp corners.

HKS has incorporated this new race inspired offset muffler and piping design into many street applications, which offers a greater flow and higher-PRM power gains due to the less restrictive design. This is achieved by eliminating unnecessary bends for the straightest exhaust path. For turbocharged applications, the large and smooth exhaust flow allows greater exhaust velocity for better mid-range boost response and high-RPM power. Naturally aspirated vehicles also benefit from greater exhaust flow capacity as engine tuning levels increase. Certain applications are available in a Silent Hi-Power version which has an inner silencer built into the muffler.

A sophisticated combination of extraordinary materials and extremely refined design lets the Rocket 33 to equally honor all types of music. Solid Conductors: Eliminate harshness and confusion due to strand interaction. Long-Grain Copper/Perfect-Surface Copper: Rocket 33 uses a carefully finessed combination of Long-Grain Copper (LGC) and extremely high-purity Perfect-Surface Copper (PSC). LGC has fewer oxides within the conducting material, less impurities, less grain boundaries and definitively better performance. The astonishingly smooth and pure PSC further eliminates harshness and greatly increases clarity. Dual-Triple Geometry: The relationship between conductors defines a cables most basic electrical values (capacitance and inductance). However, even when those variables are kept in a reasonable balance, the relationship between conductors can be varied in ways that greatly affect the sound. The Dual-Triple construction of Rocket 33 allows for significantly better dynamic contrast and information intelligibility than if the same conductors were run in parallel. Spread-Spectrum Technology (SST): Any single size or shape of conductor has a specific distortion profile. Even though radially symmetrical conductors (solid or tubular) have the fewest discontinuities, any particular size does have a sonic signature. SST is a method for significantly reducing the awareness of these character flaws by using a precise combination of different size conductors. The six different SST-determined conductor sizes used in Rocket 33 allow an exceptionally clear, clean and dynamic sound. This cable has silver bananas in Full Range.

First, it offers a usb output, allowing you to archive your vinyl tracks to your computer using easily available software you\u2019ll find on the web, including free audacity software. The second brand new feature is the ability to fine tune the pho 701 to a wide range of phono cartridges via dip switches on the bottom. With these switches, you can easily adjust the input capacitance and input impedance. The pho 701 puts its power supply in a completely separate chassis for pristine signal quality. It will reward you with an amazing vinyl experience. Separate cases for audio and power supply circuitry help isolate the signal chain from ac distortion and interference. The pho 701 performs its riaa correction with high precision for ultra low distortion and uses the highest quality audiophile parts, inside and out. It has a single phono input, which can be switched to accommodate low output mc cartridges or mm/high output mc cartridges. Vincent has deliberately omitted the typical 'wall art' ac power adapter, opting for a specially designed and highly developed outboard power supply instead. Feeling is believing. The power unit has impressive heft when held in the hand and testifies to the quality of the transformer, metal chassis, shielding, and other components. This no compromise approach to power helps the pho 701 to achieve its low noise performance. The pho 701 uses the same power supply that is already employed to great advantage in vincent's critically acclaimed pho 8 phono preamplifier. It is connected to the separate chassis audio circuitry using a nine pin din cable. The voltage is highly regulated and filtered, so that the ripple and hum found in unconditioned ac power right out of the wall will not reach the phono section. The delicate audio circuitry only receives clean power.\"] ['Two chassis mm/mc phono stage', 'Hybrid tube/solid state design', 'Highly regulated power supply in separate chassis', 'Inputs: 1x rca stereo, 1x din (dc in pho 700)'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"5.17 x 8 x 3.25 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"2.38 pounds\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"July 25, 2017\", \"Manufacturer\": \"VINCENT\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight.

This guitar is built using a larger \u201cArtist\u201d or F-Style Mandola type body to increase the resonant air chamber providing more volume, better low-end response, and adds just the right amount of timber in its voicing. Compared to our previous manditar models, the newer F-6 and F-12 uses an extended 15\u201d scale allowing for more hand room. Barre chords are even possible near the nut. The Zero Glide nut is very effective at maintaining tuning stability and allows for the lowest possible action alleviating the string tension which is common with short scale instruments. The fretboard is radiused for comfort and the ebony bridge contains a built-in pickup for easy plugged-in playing. Bottom line is this guitar is another voicing to add to your recording studio, band, solo gig, or just to jam with. If you\u2019re looking to achieve a mandolin sound without learning to play the mandolin this does the trick (although, we think you should learn mandolin too)! With the shorter scale length, it lends itself to opening tuning so you can focus more on single or harmonic notes while strumming.

The CPX series has always placed emphasis on playability, stylish medium jumbo body profile and cutting edge electronics. The CPX500, one of the worlds most widely recognized acoustic-electric guitar, has been revamped and refined for a new generation of acoustic rockers. The Yamaha Medium-Jumbo Cutaway Acoustic-Electric Guitar is available with exciting colors, upgraded pickup/preamp system, and the same exceptional playability. Case sold separately. CPX Soundhole: Round CPX' conventional round soundhole focuses the midrange, while controlling bass, for a direct, powerful sound. The more traditional CPX is great for any purpose \u201c from acoustic use at home or in the studio to full- on stage performance. Powerful, musical acoustic tone and great playability sit perfectly with natural, controllable plugged-in sound while subtler new finishes stop short of APX' modern looks but offer more personality than traditional acoustic guitars. CPX Body Depth: 95 -115mm (3 3/4\\x9d- 4 1/2\\x9d ) With an exclusive Medium-jumbo body, CPX guitars boast powerful, rich bass combined with smooth, delicate highs and sweet mid-range for an open, modern voice. Non-scalloped X-type bracing ensures a powerful yet controlled tone that allows the guitar to deliver strong, rich acoustic sounds while still remaining clear and usable on-stage. Under-Saddle Pickup System Controls for the under bridge mounted piezo pickup are mounted on the instrument' side for optimum access. The battery compartment is also located on the side, close to the neck, to provide easy replacement. System 65 System 65 features an under-saddle piezo pickup developed by Yamaha. Controls include a 3-band equalizer, an adjustable mid-range frequency control, and a precision chromatic tuner for optimum sound tailoring.

Or they can focus with the speed and precision of Phase Detection AF. They cannot do both at once. Sony changes all that with the award-winning Translucent Mirror Technology system. It directs light to both the image sensor and the Phase Detection AF sensor simultaneously. 24.3 MP; best-in-class resolution You get incredible detail and gorgeous enlargements thanks to an APS-C sensor with 24.3 megapixels.

Also enables fast processing for up to 10 fps continuous shooting of data-intensive 24.3 MP images, 2D/3D Sweep Panorama modes and 6-image layering. Sony Exmor technology Conventional image sensors use only a handful of analog-to-digital (A/D) converters, which can slow you down.

You can also see the results of camera adjustments in real time with superb color and detail.

Heavy-duty construction assuring underwater shooting down to 14 meters, for up to two hours The solid, airtight body common to the WG-80 is not only waterproof down to a depth of 14 meters for up to two hours of continuous operation (equivalent to IPX 8 or JIS Class 8), but is also shockproof against falls from a height of 1.6 meters,* dustproof (equivalent to IPX 6 or JIS Class 6), freeze-proof to temperatures as low as -10\u00b0C, and crushproof against weights up to 100kgf (kilogram force). ** Thanks to this heavy-duty construction, the cameras perform superbly and dependably even in harsh, demanding outdoor conditions. * Measured under RICOH -original testing standards \u2014 from a height of 1.6 meters, onto a surface of 5cm-thick plywood \u2014 conforming to Method 516.5-Shock of the MIL-Standard 810F. ** Measured under RICOH -original testing standards. 2. Exceptional image quality The WG-80 comes equipped with a back-illuminated CMOS image sensor, which assures excellent high-sensitivity and low-noise characteristics and high-speed readout of image data signals. Coupled with a high-performance imaging engine, this image sensor delivers a top sensitivity of ISO 6400 and super-high-resolution images with approximately 16.0 effective megapixels. These models also provide advanced image processing functions, made possible by the latest super-resolution technology, to assure sharp, clear, high-resolution images. They even offer such innovative features as Handheld Night Snap mode, which automatically captures several images of the same nighttime scene and produces a single, blur-free composite image from them. 3. Six Macro Lights to assist close-up shooting, with various functions Ideally positioned around the circumference of the lens barrel for macro shooting, six LED Macro Lights allow the WG-80 to provide bright, uniform illumination on a subject when the Digital Microscope mode is selected. Providing the maximum illumination intensity almost twice that of its predecessor and a five-step intensity adjustment function, this six-light unit enables the photographer to effortlessly optimize the close-range flash photography based on the subject or creative intention. In order to minimize camera shake and subject shake, the Instant Illumination Enhance function allows for the use of a higher shutter speed by automatically raising the discharge level of the Macro Lights at the moment of shutter release. The Macro Lights also provide other useful functions, such as a Self-Portrait Assist mode, which uses the blink of an LED lamp to check if the subject\u2019s face has been safely captured within the picture frame, and the LED Lighting mode, which uses the Macro Lights as a lighting device in the dark. 4.

With effortless, wide-open sonic performance and the ability to drive any pair of headphones without compromise, the RNHP allows you to perform, mix and enjoy your music with a new level of clarity.For much equipment, the headphone output is an afterthought. Most products with integrated headphone amps have large feature sets, small footprints, and relatively low price points. This leads to comprised power and audio quality of the headphone amplifier itself, which can lead to a number of issues in real world usage such as low headroom, unreliable performance, and a lack of focus.The RNHP was made to accomplish one simple purpose: making any headphones sound their best. As a dedicated design, the RNHP is tailored to deliver extremely high quality, powerful amplification, with precise calibration for any source input. This exceptional level of quality can be the difference that inspires an artist to give their best performance, lets an engineer make better choices in mic and placement, gives a mix engineer reliable translation of EQ and dynamics adjustments, or lets a music listener appreciate the full depth and detail of a recording.In addition to being able to drive a wide variety of headphones without sacrificing performance, the RNHP is also capable of receiving a wide array of signals with its 3 inputs, calibrated for optimum level and impedance.'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"14 x 7 x 4 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"3.03 pounds\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"June 20, 2016\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Rupert Neve Designs\", \"Brand\": \"Rupert Neve Designs\", \"Connectivity Technology\": \"Wired\", \"Style\": \"Modern\", \"Color\": \"White, Black\", \"Compatible Devices\": \"Headphone\", \"Voltage\": \"24 Volts\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"14 x 7 x 4 inches\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

In this tradition, House of Troy carefully crafts each light for you by hand, to the highest quality standards. This floor lamp will create a stunning presence in any room and works well with many styles of decor. Showcasing the classic lines and the turned details of the lamp's body, the oil rubbed bronze finish is paired with an off White silk soft back shade that measures 15-Inch by 16-Inch by 10-Inch. Oil rubbed Bronze is a very dark, oxidized finish and its rich metallic tones are an industry standard. Finish patinas are achieved by coloring solid brass with an application of acid oxide. All oxidized finishes are protected with a finish coat of matte lacquer. All of these elements give this lamp its beauty, while the heavy, circular base ensures safety by minimizing tipping of the 16-Inch wide by 61-Inch tall lamp. A 3-way bulb allows for ample illumination beside your reading chair or a soft glow or a soft glow at the bedside. The CH800-OB uses one medium-base A21, 150W (maximum) bulb controlled by a 3-way turn switch on the socket housing. The base measures 10-Inch in diameter, with a factory formed opening for the polarized plug and 10-foot brown cord. The metal components of House of Troy products should be cleaned with warm water and a soft cloth; using soaps or glass cleaners may damage the metal finish. This fixture is sold one per package and is UL listed in the USA and Canada. Tucked into the northern Vermont hills, House of Troy has been producing classic lighting since the mid 1940s.
