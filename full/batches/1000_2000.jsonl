The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-180x. The 8MP camera has a CMOS color sensor, a reduction lens, image capture and editing software, and USB 2.0 output to capture or display still or video images on a computer or projector. The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port. The WH10x20mm and WH20x10mm super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces combine with the 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective to provide zoom magnification and a longer working distance for inspecting large-scale specimens that require handling or repair. The microscope comes with 0.5x and 2.0x Barlow lenses that can be added to the objective to increase the magnification range. A Barlow lens with a magnification of less than 1.0 reduces magnification and increases the working distance, while a Barlow lens with a magnification greater than 1.0 increases the magnification and reduces the working distance. High-eyepoint eyepieces ease viewing for users who wear glasses, and dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences.

The guitar also has an integrated set neck joint and, Indian rosewood fretboard and bridge, and a Quantum I pickup for a great plugged-in experience. This is an excellent guitar for the price you pay.

The Performer Series also includes select pressure tested solid spruce tops, flame maple veneer headstocks, a custom polished high-gloss finish, Quantum 1 electronics and embroidered gig bag. The ideal package for the gigging musician.', 'Compound Curve Top Design', \"The guitar top is the part of the instrument that most affects the sound. It is also the most delicate part of any high quality acoustic guitar. The grade and thickness of the wood used (solid spruce), as well as the bracing structure, have a huge impact on the instrument's sound. The idea of applying an arch or a curve to the top is appealing because the added strength of an arched top should allow for the use of a thinner and more lightly braced top. While this is true, there remains a trade-off in applying a curve to the entire top. The most active part of the top is the area centered on the bridge. Applying a curve to this part of the top restricts movement resulting in a loss of dynamic range. On the other hand, the area of the top above the sound hole moves minimally but is problematic because it tends to sink if the guitar dries out even slightly. This tendency is also encouraged by downward pressure from the fingerboard resting on top of it. The solution is a top that has a compound curve. In the Seagull Performer's design the top is arched slightly in the area above the sound hole and levels out in the area around the bridge. The compound curve top produces excellent stability in the upper part of the guitar top and the power and projection made possible by leaving the top flat below the sound hole flat. With the weak area above the sound hole stabilized, it is possible to make the rest of the top even more active with a new bracing design that allows unprecedented control over the top vibration. The bracing for the Seagull Performer Cutaway Flame Maple High-Gloss QI Guitar is quarter-sawn spruce, scalloped and carved to conform exactly to the curvature of the tops.\", 'A History of Quality', \"In 1982 Robert Godin and a few friends produced the first Seagull guitars in the Village of LaPatrie, Quebec.

Includes The Teacher Demonstration Balance Scale and Game Pieces and 20 Sets of Student Manipulatives. Grade 3 and up. ['Hands-On Equations is a manipulatives-based instructional system that can be used with any math curriculum to provide students in grades 3 and up with a concrete introduction to algebraic linear equations. It uses the visual and hands-on instructional approach developed by Dr. Henry Borenson to simplify the learning of abstract algebraic concepts. This hands-on, intuitive approach enhances student self-esteem and interest in mathematics while providing a solid foundation for later algebraic studies. In Level I, students use the red cubes and blue pawns to set up and solve equations such as: 4x + 3 = 3x + 9 and 2(2x + 1) = 3x + 10. In Level II, students use the red cubes, blue pawns, and white pawns to set up and solve equations such as: 2x + (-x) + 3 = 2(-x) + 12 and 2x - (-x) = 15. In Level III, students use the red cubes, blue pawns, white pawns, and green cubes to set up and solve equations such as: 2x + 3 = - 6 + x and x - 2(x + 2) = 5. Once students represent the equation on their laminated balance scale, they then use \"legal moves\" to simplify and solve the equation. Without even realizing it, students learn sophisticated algebraic concepts, such as the relational meaning of equality, the distributive property of multiplication over addition, the subtraction and addition properties of equality, the additive property of zero and the property of additive inverses. The program is straightforward to use and well-illustrated. It does not require any algebraic prerequisites from the student, teacher, or parent. However, it would be helpful if the students can do simple calculations such as 8 + 7 or 7 + 7 + 7. Knowledge of multiplication or division is not required but is helpful. Since 1990, more than 50,000 teachers and one million students have used Hands-On Equations in the United States.'] ['Visual and kinesthetic approach simplifies the teaching of algebraic concepts', 'Makes algebraic linear equations accessible to students as early as the 3rd grade', 'Uses game pieces to physically represent and solve algebraic linear equations', 'The conceptual learning enables students to experience a high level of success', 'Provides students with a solid foundation for later algebraic work'] {\"Manufacturer\": \"Borenson and Associates, Inc.\", \"Brand\": \"HANDS-ON \", \"Item Weight\": \"7.26 pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"17.5 x 5.25 x 12 inches\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Size\": \"20 Sets\", \"Manufacturer Part Number\": \"C-1020\", \"Date First Available\": \"January 8, 2015\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

They are the direct link between the front wheels and the chassis. Any deflection causes a change in alignment, which results in poor performance and driving feel. Fabricated from heavy-duty 1.25-inch, 0.095-inch wall DOM tubing with DOM cross braces for extra strength, deflection is eliminated with A-arms from BMR Suspension. BMR\u2019s AA031 Upper and Lower A-arms are equipped with CNC machined, nickel-plated, dual-offset cross-shafts with heavy-duty stainless bushing retainers. They come pre-assembled with new polyurethane bump stops, and new upper ball joints are included. Greasable, 95-durometer bushings add a solid, more responsive feel over the stock rubber bushings. BMR\u2019s bushings are internally fluted, which allows grease to evenly coat the inner sleeve. These flutes also direct grease to the outer edge of the bushing, keeping the thrust surface lubricated. BMR\u2019s AA031 Upper and Lower A-arms eliminate deflection, greatly improving steering feel and response in normal and performance driving situations. The compact design provides additional header clearance over stock A-arms, allowing you to run larger primary tubes for high-horsepower applications. The polyurethane bushings add strength and reduce deflection over the stock rubber bushing, while still absorbing much of the NVH. The means you get a great blend of performance and comfort. Designed for street performance, drag race, and handling, and pro-touring applications. These A-arms give you improved geometry and increased lateral grip during cornering situations. The AA031\u2019s adds 4-degrees of caster adjustability for improved high-speed stability. The upper arms also have revised cross shaft geometry and shorter overall length, requiring less shim stack to achieve negative camber on lowered cars, or race and pro touring vehicles with aggressive alignments.'] ['Fits 1970-1981 GM F-Body.

Our customers tend to consider these bits to be a better value compared to high-grade bits that are a lot more expensive.

Although the optical design is state-of-the-art, this superb wide angle lens remains true to the original Sonnar concept with a bright F2.8 maximum aperture (\u201cSonne\u201d means \u201csun\u201d in German). Three double-sided aspherical elements minimize aberration so that stunning contrast and resolution are maintained right out to the image edges at all apertures. The renowned T* lens coating contributes to natural color reproduction as well. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh\u2019 effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. \u03b1 lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. Coated optics were pioneered by Carl Zeiss - and this superb lens features the Carl Zeiss T* (T-Star) coating that virtually eliminates lens flare, internal reflection and light scattering that can otherwise occur at glass-to-air surfaces. The T* coating contributes to outstanding image quality, with high contrast and uniformly excellent resolution right out to the image edges. Not simply applied to any lens - the T* symbol only appears on multi-element lenses in which the required performance has been achieved throughout the entire optical path, therefore guaranteeing the highest quality.

This laser imaging research enabled Polk to view on a microscopic level the entire vibrating surface of a driver or tweeter. By this method Polk was able to observe the resonances, which develop on speaker cones as they move. These resonances are the root cause of frequency response distortions. As an x-ray enables a physician to discover the root cause of a symptom and prescribe the right treatment for a cure, this laser imaging technique allowed Polk engineers to find the right combinations of high tech materials, geometry and construction techniques to tune out the offending resonances. The benefit of Dynamic Balance is the dramatic improvement in the sound quality of our speakers, which every listener can appreciate. You no longer have to choose between excellent bass and smooth, clear midrange. Now you can have it all thanks to Dynamic Balance technology. A crossover is the part of the speaker system, which directs high frequencies to the tweeter and lower range frequencies to the woofer. But crossovers can create distortion, called phase shift, which reduces clarity and degrades the ability of the speaker to create a life-like spatial image. Thanks to Dynamic Balance technology, the response of Polk's mid-woofers remains accurate at much higher frequencies than conventional drivers. This allows Polk to place the crossover frequency above the range where your ear can most easily detect phase shirt (the critical midrange). The result is clarity and imaging so outstanding that the speakers seem to melt away. You'll feel as if you're at a live performance or actually on the movie set. And the result of all these technologies? One listen will tell you. You\"] [' CLEAR SOUND & DEEP BASS for a true cinematic experience.

The Avantone MixCubes are shielded, full-range mini reference monitors. Their design is inspired by the legacy of the 5C Sound Cubes used in virtually all-major studios for the last 25 years. Engineering Objective To build a full-range, rugged, mini-reference monitor to replace the older, aging, 5C Sound Cubes that are still in use worldwide, while offering an improved, more linear frequency response. A full year was spent studying all versions & revisions of the famous little 5C Sound Cubes. Research revealed that there were several driver versions released over the years with widely varying frequency response characteristics. Avantone chose the smoothest, most linear, full-range version of those 5C models to use as their testing benchmark. Next, they analyzed their response characteristics in an anechoic chamber and proceeded to implement design upgrades. Realizing the importance of replacing a respected \"industry-standard reference monitor\", they began by replicating its basic size, function, and sonic character. And then they took it up a notch. Cabinet Design The original 5C Sound Cubes were made of \u00bd\" particleboard covered with a glue-on woodgrain contact paper. They chose to use thicker, denser MDF board because of its high rigidity and inherent low-resonance characteristics. Starting with a 165mm (6 1/2\") sealed cube design with radiused edges, they chose an elegant polyurethane high-gloss \"RETRO-CREAM\" finish. The originals had either screws, or on later models, plastic binding posts, mounted on a recessed plastic cup. These have been upgraded to high-end nickel-plated, machined solid metal binding posts (dual banana spacing) mounted on a black anodized, milled and silk-screened aluminum terminal plate. Next Avontone added a 7mm thick neoprene pad embedded into the base of the cabinet to serve as a skid-resistant acoustic isolator. Additionally, for creative mounting situations, Avontone recessed an industry st...'] ['General', 'Size: Near-field', 'System type: Passive', 'Configuration: Single driver', 'Drivers'] {\"Item Weight\": \"15.1 Pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"17\\\"D x 9.6\\\"W x 9.4\\\"H\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"October 2, 2001\", \"Speaker Amplification Type\": \"Passive\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Wattage\": \"200 watts\", \"Brand\": \"Avantone\", \"Speaker Type\": \"Monitor\", \"Speaker Maximum Output Power\": \"200 Watts\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The PCIe controller card connects directly to the PCI Expansion box with an included DVI cable for a reliable, high quality connection. A dependable I/O expansion solution, the Expansion Chassis is backed by StarTech.com's 2-year warranty and free lifetime technical support. Expand an existing system's I/O capabilities without having to purchase an entirely new system. Ideal for system testers, and engineers who may need to regularly swap out I/O cards.

It is also the first snorkel designed with the modular functionality of a Pre-filter Low Mount and Ram High Mount air intake design. Unlike other snorkels, you don't have to give up flexibility for functionality. Not only did we engineer our snorkel to allow the windshield to fold and doors to be removed, we built it for use with our dual battery tray, windshield light bar and windshield light mounting tabs. The Modular XHD Snorkel System comes standard with the Pre-filter Low Mount. The Pre-filter Low Mount relocates the air intake to just below the windshield and draws cool air from outside the hot engine compartment. The optional Ram High Mount design allows the air intake to be extended up an additional 21 inch to the top of the windshield. The two air intake mounts are easily interchangeable to give you the modular functionality best suited to your needs. The system is manufactured from premium thermoformed plastic, mandrel bent aluminum and hi-temp silicone connection hoses. Built in manual drain valves channel away excess water to prevent it from entering the intake system. It installs with minor modification to the fender, but without the major cutting and surgery that other kits require.

This technique, which comes from studio microphones, prevents sound distortion and optimises speech recognition results. The specially designed hexagonal openings of the metal cover provide a three times larger open surface area than the previous model, ensuring crystal clear shots. Non-woven fabric above and below the microphone capsule filters out sound distortion such as pop or hissing sounds and allows perfect recording results even when dictating close to the microphone. The SpeechMike Premium Touch is equipped with an extra-large speaker, so that the recordings taken with it can also be played clearly and without interference. Thanks to its ergonomic shape, the device fits perfectly in the hand and incorrect operation is less common. The shutter release and control button on the back of the device are attached so that they can be easily reached with your fingers. The Philips SpeechMike Premium has an integrated motion sensor. It detects when placed on the table and mutes the microphone. Once you take it back to hand, the microphone will be activated again. In addition, custom events can be programmed when the device interrupts and resumes recording. The device is equipped with a touch sensor. The user can easily control and navigate applications while recording without having to switch between mouse and microphone. The hygienic surface of the SpeechMike case physically makes it difficult to settle germs and thus improves the efficiency of the usual measures for disinfecting the device. The high-quality polished pearl metallic surface also makes the device resistant to touch noise and fingerprints. The SpeechMike Premium Touch has freely configurable buttons that are particularly suitable for programming voice recognition commands. The device can be personalised for each user for the respective application. The user can upgrade from their previous SpeechMike model without having to install additional software. For integrators, this means no changes need to be implemented and that the existing SDK can continue to be used.

It's the same 3CCD technology used in Panasonic professional broadcast equipment, resulting in 540 lines of breathtaking resolution. You can count on Panasonic 3CCD Digital Camcorders to give you colors that are as rich and vibrant as your life. World-renowned lens-maker LEICA has developed an exquisite, 12-element, multi-coated lens that helps add a high-level of detail and subtlety to your creations. With refinements like a 2-stage neutral density filter for aperture independent adjustment, you'll appreciate the remarkably crisp, true-to-life color that is a hallmark of Leica Dicomar optics. The Optical Image Stabilizer helps you obtain clear, beautiful pictures by compensating for any hand movement that occurs as you shoot video. Gyrosensors detect the amount and direction of movement, while a linear motor adjusts the lenses as needed to compensate. You get clear, sharp images in situations where hand-shake is typically a problem, like wide-angle shots or high magnification levels of the zoom. What does all this mean? You can use this camcorder for recording great video and still images. Using an SD memory card (2GB included) with optional cards available to 4GB, the SDR-S150 is incredibly tiny; easy to carry and use.

The S150 also uses Panasonic's proprietary Quad-Density Pixel Distribution technology to convert the image signal. Providing four times the pixel density when recording still pictures, this lets the S150 capture 3.1-megapixel (2048 x 1512) still pictures.

Cable Winder, & Hose Garage - Use the T-LOC's to attach your , , or SYS-Tool Box to the new SYS-Dock in an instant (accepts Systainer3's, T-LOC and Classic Systainers). This strong, secure coupling transforms your dust extractor into a mobile workstation, with all your working materials at your fingertips so you can get started right away without wasting time unwinding the cable thanks to the new folding mechanism. - Stronger Hose Garage - The hose garage has been reinforced and strengthened for better durability. - Bluetooth Remote Capabilities - The combination of the Bluetooth Module on your CT Dust Extractor and the Remote Control (module & remote sold separately) on the suction hose saves you from having to go over to the dust extractor. Simply start the dust extractor from the hose using the remote control. This is ideal for occasional cleanup jobs. Additionally, when used with the Bluetooth Battery Packs (sold separately in 4.0, 5.2 & 6.2 Ah versions), the Bluetooth module will start the dust extractor when you switch your cordless tool on. You can now benefit from Festool's perfectly designed dust-free system when you're working with Festool cordless products. - Filtration - In addition, this unit comes standard with HEPA filtration and self-cleaning filter bags in addition to all of the standard features included with all of Festool dust extractors. The CT 26 tends to be the most popular of Festool's dust extractors, offering the best combination of power, capacity, price and portability. It is great for the shop, especially when used in conjunction with the optional CT boom arm to create a workstation that keeps cords and hoses out of the way of your work. - Mobile & Compact - While not as compact as the CT MINI or MIDI, the CT 26 maintains a high degree of mobility, while delivering the next to highest capacity in the Festool line-up. With relatively compact dimensions, this dust extractor is small enough to be stored under a bench. At less than 30 pounds, it is still light enough to be taken on the road, or carried up the stairs. - And MORE! - The CT 26 is equipped with Festool's standard tool-triggered dust extraction, anti-static design, adjustable power/ s ['Maximum utilization of the container volume \u2013 the gross volume is the same as the net volume', 'Can be individually retrofitted with an additional compressed air or Bluetooth module for remote control on the suction hose or automatic start via the Bluetooth battery pack.', 'Constantly high suction because of the compact high performance turbine', 'Smooth suction hose and optimized SYS-Dock with cord holder and T-LOC function for conveniently connecting Systainers to the mobile dust extractor', 'Antistatic function prevents static developing during work', 'Attachment of Systainers via SYS-Dock', 'Hose garage and cable windup for greater tidiness and safety', 'Economical because of the optimal use of the available volume with a filter bag in the container', 'Container/filter bag capacity 26/24 l'] {\"Brand\": \"Festool\", \"Special Feature\": \"Bag\", \"Form Factor\": \"Cannister\", \"Filter Type\": \"Cartridge\", \"Model Name\": \"Festool 577083\", \"Surface Recommendation\": \"Hard Floor\","}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Fortuna's identity as the embodiment of chance events was closely tied to virtus, or strength of character. Public officials who lacked this quality invited ill-fortune on both themselves and Rome. At Montegrappa, they strongly believe that luck is indubitably linked to virtue, while education is the foundation onto which an individual develops and nurtures his or her innate talents. They also believe that hand-writing is an essential element of the education process and an indispensable function, even in today's hurried, digitized society. For this reason, they continue the Fortuna collection, now in blue with palladium or rose gold trim, with an eye to those who still indulge in the pleasure of writing.
