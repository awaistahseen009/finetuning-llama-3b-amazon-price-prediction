The trinocular head has a vertical camera mount and a Siedentopf binocular mount with interchangeable pairs of WH10x and WH20x eyepieces, 55 to 75mm Siedentopf interpupillary adjustment, a fixed 30-degree vertical inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and a 360-degree rotation capability to provide a more comprehensive view and enable sharing. Dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. The vertical trinocular port accepts a camera with a 23mm or C-Mount adapter (camera sold separately). The mechanical tube length is 6-5/16\" (160mm). The reverse-mounted revolving nosepiece has 4x, 10x, 40xS, and 100xS (oil) DIN achromatic semi-plan objectives that provide color correction of magnified images. The 40xS objective is spring loaded to prevent slide damage when focusing. The 100xS spring-loaded oil-immersion objective uses oil between the specimen and the objective lens to provide increased resolution over a standard objective. Semi-plan objectives provide improved focus over the central 80 percent of the viewing field. A compound microscope is used for inspection and dissection of specimens when two-dimensional images are desired.', 'The microscope has Brightfield illumination. Brightfield (BF) illumination allows the specimen to absorb light, resulting in a dark image on a light background. Halogen illumination provides bright light in a concentrated path, and a Kohler condenser focuses and centers the light path using two iris diaphragms, providing optimum contrast and resolution. The graduated double-layer mechanical stage, with 1mm stage divisions, locks the slide into place and provides precise slide manipulation along the X- and Y-axis to allow coordinates to be recorded, enabling the viewer to return to a specific location on the slide. A stage stop prevents the stage or specimen from coming into contact with the objectives. The stage is 7.1 x 5.9 inches (180 x 150mm) and a traveling range of 2-3/4 x 2 inches (70 x 50mm). Graduated coaxial coarse and fine focus has a focusing range of 1-3/16\" (30mm) and fine-focus divisions of 0.002mm (0.\") that enable measurements to be taken.

It has a depth rating of 148'. Mechanical and button controls afford access to key camera functions, including the zoom ring, mode dial, multi-selector, movie recording, playback, delete and menu buttons. The light from the camera's built-in flash is blocked by the housing, but it can still be used to trigger 1 or 2 optional SB-N10 Underwater Speedlight flash units when these are connected to the housing's fiber-optic ports via cables, which are available separately. A built-in cold shoe mount located on top of the housing permits the attachment of optional accessories, such as lighting arms. The housing's built-in port is designed specifically to accommodate the 1 NIKKOR 11-27.5mm or VR 10-30mm lens. Included with the housing is the WP-AN1000 Wrist Strap, which helps ensure that the WP-N3, with camera inside, doesn't get away from you while you're shooting. Also included, the WP-LC1000 Front Cap covers the lens port when the housing is not in use, protecting it against scratches and preventing dust, dirt and debris buildup. The supplied WP-AN2000 Front Cap Strap attaches the Front Cap to the housing to ensure it's not lost when removed. The bundled WP-IR1010 Inner-Reflection Prevention Ring and WP-IS1000 Inner-Reflection Prevention Sticker keep unwanted reflections from appearing in your images.

Features - Smooth Hose - This most recent version also includes a re-designed suction hose. This smooth hose is both tapered and flexible - with a smooth exterior for easy sliding over surfaces and a longer service life. On the interior, its conical geometry improves suction by reducing friction and increasing airflow, resulting in better suction and faster progress with your work. The new tool connection sleeve ensures a secure fit on the tool. - Re-Designed Hose Connectors - With a bayonet fitting for secure connection of the suction hose to the tool and, if needed, to connect two suction hoses to each other to produce one long hose. - SYS-DOCK. Cable Winder, & Hose Garage - Use the T-LOC's to attach your , , or SYS-Tool Box to the new SYS-Dock in an instant (accepts Systainer3's, T-LOC and Classic Systainers). This strong, secure coupling transforms your dust extractor into a mobile workstation, with all your working materials at your fingertips so you can get started right away without wasting time unwinding the cable thanks to the new folding mechanism. - Stronger Hose Garage - The hose garage has been reinforced and strengthened for better durability. - Bluetooth Remote Capabilities - The combination of the Bluetooth Module on your CT Dust Extractor and the Remote Control (module & remote sold separately) on the suction hose saves you from having to go over to the dust extractor. Simply start the dust extractor from the hose using the remote control. This is ideal for occasional cleanup jobs. Additionally, when used with the Bluetooth Battery Packs (sold separately in 4.0, 5.2 & 6.2 Ah versions), the Bluetooth module will start the dust extractor when you switch your cordless tool on. You can now benefit from Festool's perfectly designed dust-free system when you're working with Festool cordless products. In addition, this unit comes standard with HEPA filtration and self-cleaning filter bags in addition to all of the standard features included with all of Festool dust extractors. The CT 36 offers a great combination of power, capacity, price and portability. It is great for the shop, especially when used in conjunction with the optional CT boom arm to create a workstation that keeps cords and hoses out of the way of your work. While not as compact as the CT MINI, MIDI or 26, the CT 36 maintains a high degree of mobility, while delivering the next to highest capacity in the Festool line-up. With relatively compact dimensions, this dust extractor is small enough to be stored under a bench. At around 30 pounds, it is still light enough to be taken on the road, or carried up the stairs. The CT 36 is equipped with Festool's standard tool-triggered dust extraction, anti-static design, adjustable power/ suction settings, locking brake and Systainer storage.

A truly revolutionary product with ground breaking technology, SkyProdigy\u2122 is the product of a culmination of decades of telescope advancements. It combines electronic motors, an intelligent on-board computer, a digital camera and StarSense\u2122 technology to create an automatic, instant alignment telescope that requires no input from the user. Simply turn it on, push a button and enjoy the view! It\u2019s that easy. The SkyProdigy\u2019s automatic alignment process takes only a few minutes, then you will be ready to select from thousands of objects to view. Not sure what to look at? Select the Sky Tour option; this feature offers a customized list of the best objects in the sky to view for your exact time and location anywhere in the world! No knowledge of the night sky is required. One touch innovation turns anyone into an instant astronomer! Celestron\u2019s SkyProdigy telescopes use an integrated imaging camera and patented StarSense Technology to automatically align with the night sky and determine where the telescope is currently pointing. The camera automatically captures an image of the sky, which is processed internally to positively identify the stars in the image. Once a positive match is found, SkyProdigy determines the coordinates of the center of the captured image. The process is automatically repeated two more times so that the system has three known alignment points that can be used to make an accurate model of the night sky. From this information the user can select any celestial object in the hand controller\u2019s database, and SkyProdigy will automatically move itself to the correct position. *The SkyProdigy\u2019s internal camera does not have an external output allowing users to view or save the captured images.

Each of the 3 sections has its own set of keys, which allows a user to split them up by department or group. A college, for example, could present announcements and messages from 3 different clubs, teams or educational departments, all in one centralized location.

Some 120 rounds of ammunition were carried on the vehicle, while another 432 rounds could be stowed in a special trailer. Sd.Kfz.7/2 systems were produced by Germany beginning in 1942 and from late 1943, instead of the usual open cab, a number of antiaircraft halftracks were supplied with a cab protected by 8mm-thick armor plate. These vehicles served in Luftwaffe flak units. This kit includes the armored cab as well as a magnificently detailed 3.7cm Flak 43 cannon.

Moreover the gun mount of this anti-aircraft gun is also new! The drop-sides on the rear fighting platform can be modeled upright for transport, or folded down for an in-action diorama.

Product Highlights Dual 4 ohm voice coils for many wiring options Extensively vented motor eliminates compression and allows quiet excursion Extra-thick black anodized aluminum cone for maximum rigidity Triple shorting-ring motor for ultra-low distortion Parameters optimized for small enclosures Highest quality materials throughout for long-lasting performance Product Manuals / Spec Sheets / Downloads Dayon Audio -44 Specification Sheet Dayton Audio -44 Data Files AddThis Sharing Buttons Share to FacebookFacebook Share to TwitterTwitter Share to MoreAddThis 2 Product Description Dayton Audios 10\" -44 High Output Reference Series subwoofer is purpose-built for moving lots of air, extreme power handling, extremely low distortion... and it does it all with an extremely small enclosure requirement! The minimum airspace optimization of this driver makes it perfect for car audio automotive applications and limited space home audio applications. To minimize distortion, three copper short-circuit paths are built into the motor. This reduces second, third, and intermodulation distortion to levels only attained previously by expensive, exotic subwoofers. A side benefit is reduced energy storage and inductance, making the -44 a very musical subwoofer. In fact, frequency response remains very flat up to 500 Hz. Additional features include: a heavy gauge black anodized aluminum cone that resists deformation from extreme air pressure levels found inside of small sealed enclosures, a fully ventilated motor for reduced power compression, a rigid cast aluminum frame for structural integrity, and a tough rubber surround that wont wear down over years of use. Dual 4-ohm voice coils allow for a wide array of wiring options. As with all Dayton Audio subwoofers, you receive a full 5-year warranty. Designed and engineered in the U.S.A.

Its geometric shape was designed to complement the tight radius sink trend. Its cylindrical body and rectangular spout give the PANERA an aesthetic that has the unique ability to integrate as it stands out. In action, the cylindrical, European-style pull-out spray is ergonomically comfortable to use when switching between the dual spray modes.

Dollar for dollar, the Multimax 14e remains one of the purest cutting machines available. Its 14\" throat is ample for many classic scollsaw projects, and its thickness capacity of just under 2\" easily handles even muitiple layers of the 1/2\" and 3/4\" material most commonly used for typical scrolling. The 14e\\'s powerful single-speed induction motor is linked directly to the sawing frame with high-performance, maintenance-free anti-friction bearings to provide highly reliable and versatile performance, able to handle a wide range of projects with high levels of comfort and control. A 45-degree tilting table adds the ability to saw a full range of bevels, and an automatic, built-in sawdust blower is also standard equipment. Most importantly, the Multimax-14e uses a pure, unadulterated \"perfect parallelogram\" sawing action, keeping the blade perfectly vertical while moving it slightly forward on the sawing downstroke, and returning it an equally minute distance back on the returning upstroke. This action is a cornerstone of the unique HEGNER cutting \"feel\" that has gained so many thousands of fans around the world, and it makes this machine very enjoyable to use. Just as important, this action is largely responsible for both the smooth action that reduces workpiece lifting and chatter so remarkably, and also for the superb finish left on the sawn edges, which in many materials can actually appear polished and require no sanding whatsoever!'] ['All cast construction', 'Single Speed Maintenance free sealed induction motor', 'Easy blade change', 'Highly precise', 'Unsurpassed reliabilty'] {\"Brand\": \"Hegner\", \"Blade Material\": \"High Speed Steel\", \"Power Source\": \"Ac\", \"Voltage\": \"110 Volts\", \"Blade Length\": \"14 Inches\", \"Cutting Angle\": \"45 Degrees\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Hegner\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"August 28, 2008\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Featuring a 180-degree diagonal angle view, the Lumix G Fisheye 8mm/F3.5 lens offers a distinctive perspective and unique deformation effect, creating a creative view for both photos and video. Additionally, its compact size can be attributed to its ten lenses in nine groups, which takes advantage of the Micro Four Thirds system standard to achieve dramatic downsizing. The adoption of an ED (Extra-low dispersion glass) lens achieves a stable, descriptive performance at all distances, to minimize chromatic aberration and distortion. The Lumix G Fisheye 8mm lens has the ability to capture extreme close-ups from far away, due in part to its advanced inner focus system. The H-F008, Fisheye 8mm lens allows for use of the high-speed and accurate contrast AF system when mounted on the Panasonic Lumix G Series DSLM cameras, for more comfortable and enjoyable shooting.

The switches feature D-Link Green 3.0 technology which enables significant power savings. Support for IPv6 management and configuration features ensures your network remains protected after an upgrade from IPv4 to IPv6. By offering multiple management options, these switches allow quick deployment, infrastructure expansion, and seamless upgrades. With a Limited Lifetime Warranty, the DGS-1500 SmartPro switches provide the functionality, security, and manageability need for business networks of all sizes. Equipped with a complete lineup of L2 features, these switches include IGMP Snooping, Port Mirroring, Spanning Tree, Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), and Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP). Network maintenance features include Loopback Detection and Cable Diagnostics. D-Link\u2019s innovative Safeguard Engine protects the switches against traffic flooding caused by virus attacks. The switches also support 802.1X port-based authentication, allowing the network clients to be authenticated through external RADIUS servers. In addition, the Access Control List (ACL) feature enhances network security and protects the network by screening traffic from illegal MAC or IP addresses. ARP Spoofing Prevention prevents malicious intruders from sending massive fake ARP messages through a manipulated source. For added security, the DHCP Server Screening feature blocks rogue DHCP server packets from user ports to prevent unauthorized IP assignment.', 'Amazon.com'] ['Sixteen (16) 10/100/-T Ports', 'Four (4) Gigabit SFP Ports', 'Centralized management (Virtual Stacking) via D-Link intuitive single IP management', 'Layer 3 Static Routing for scalable network design', 'IPv6 management / IPv6 Neighbor Discovery / IPv6 static routing'] {\"National Stock Number\": \"7025-01-615-2333\", \"Brand\": \"D-Link\", \"Item Weight\": \"5 Pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"23 x 16.5 x 3 inches\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"23 x 16.5 x 3 inches\", \"Manufacturer\": \"D-Link Systems, Inc.\", \"Language\": \"English\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"April 12, 2012\", \"Number of Ports\": \"16\", \"Compatible Devices\": \"Desktop\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"23 x 16.5 x 3 inches\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

A new zoom lock button keeps the lens safe and secure when not in use or used at a wide angle.\", 'From the Manufacturer', \"Canon raises the stakes for professional photography with its EF 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 DO IS USM telephoto lens with image stabilization. Thanks to a new triple-layered diffractive optical element (DO), this 70-300mm lens is less than 4 inches (10 cm) long. It can focus down to 4.6 feet (without rotating the front element) and a new zoom lock button keeps the lens safe and secure when not in use or used at the wide angle. A virtually silent ultra-sonic motor (USM) gives the lens extremely fast autofocus. The lens also includes Canon's Image Stabilization technology to dramatically reduce camera shake, compensating for approximately three stops in shutter speed without any perceptible increase in image blur. It's a great choice for professional photojournalists and serious advanced amateurs who need to contain the size and weight of equipment carried.\", 'DO Elements', \"Use of the new three-layer DO lens drastically reduces the overall length and weight of the lens system increasing the refractive power of each lens element and reducing the spaces between elements.
