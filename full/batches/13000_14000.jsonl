This allows users to select favorite images and movie files, pick a style, and then select a music file from one of the five pre-installed files in the camera--or even add their own music via PictureProject for Windows only--to suit the show. Pictmotion then automatically analyzes all these elements to produce highly entertaining shows that are coupled with pace and transition selected to match the chosen music and style.', 'These shows can then be played back anywhere, anytime on the ample-sized 3.0-inch LCD monitor, and because the LCD offers a surprisingly wide viewing angle of 170 degrees (both horizontal and vertical), such in-camera entertainment can be enjoyed by everyone at the same time. The camera also features Auto Image Rotation, which detects pictures that have been taken with the camera held vertically, automatically rotating them to suit in-camera LCD playback.', 'With the Coolpix S6, image quality is a top priority: the camera offers a 1/2.5-inch CCD and 6.0 effective megapixel resolution to produce images that stay sharp even when significantly enlarged. It also features a high-quality 3x Zoom-Nikkor ED lens with a range of 35-105mm (35mm equivalent) that gives the photographer the flexibility to zoom out for beautiful landscapes, zoom in for tightly-composed portraits, and enjoy macro photography from as close as 4 centimeters.', 'The Coolpix S6 has been specially designed to be visually appealing as well as easy to use. The eye-catching wave-surface design is about more than just great styling--its thin, compact dimensions and form make the Coolpix S6 really comfortable to hold.', 'In terms of control, the camera features a new rotary multi-selector that allows fast circular scrolling for speedy image browsing at up to 10 frames per second, a range of buttons that further simplify operation, and an on-screen icon with a cursor that tracks circular scrolling, making it easy to select desired features. Furthermore, users can select functions by name or icon according to their personal preference, and all menus and icons have been made easier on the eye with a new color scheme and optimized icon dimensions.', \"The Coolpix S6 also boasts a new one-touch portrait button, conveniently located at the top of the camera body, making it much simpler to take better quality pictures by offering easy access to Nikon's unique Face-priority AF, In-Camera Red-Eye Fix, and D-Lighting functions.

The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-90x. The 1.3MP camera has a CMOS color sensor, a reduction lens, image capture and editing software, and USB 2.0 output to capture or display still or video images on a computer or projector. The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port.

This unique combination of quality reverse osmosis membranes results in top-of-the-line performance rates for removing chlorine, hardness, heavy metals, toxins, and a long list of other water impurities.The system also features a built in booster pump and pressure gauge. A booster pump takes the incoming water pressure and brings it up to the optimal level for the reverse osmosis process. This not only increases the system\\'s production rate, but it also maximizes the efficiency in terms of drain to pure water ratio. By monitoring a drop in pressure on the gauge, you can determine when the system\\'s pre filters are due for a change. Compared to the industry standard 10\" filters, the RCB3P\\'s 20\" oversized pre filters have the capacity to trap twice as many contaminants. This allows the system to be used heavily in commercial environments without needing to change the filters as frequently. Restaurants, salons, labs, and offices all benefit in their own ways from high quality RO water, and the RCB3P gets the job done.', 'NOTE:', 'All flow rates stated on our reverse osmosis systems and membranes are assuming a water temperature of 77\u00b0F. Water temperature changes will affect the flow rate. For every degree F the temperature lowers, about 3% of product flow is lost. For every degree F the temperature increases, about 3% product flow rate is gained. This occurs because water with a higher temperature has a lower viscosity and higher diffusion rate, which makes it easier for the water to permeate the RO membrane.

While Fight's signature beige color has already become legendary, Flight wanted something different for this series, which is why they went for a Burgundy Red with a purple infusion.

The image sensor affords notable sensitivity, to an expandable ISO 25600, with a high signal-to-noise ratio for a cleaner image quality with reduced image noise. Designed for effective hybrid photo and video recording performance, the 4K output can also be used to permit in-camera 8MP screen grabs from video files for simplified multimedia output. Complementing the imaging performance is a long-reaching 16x Leica DC Vario-Elmarit zoom lens, which provides a 35mm-equivalent focal length range of 25-400mm. Covering wide-angle to telephoto perspectives, this f/2.8-4 lens incorporates aspherical and extra-low dispersion elements within its construction to realize a sharp, clear image quality with minimal chromatic aberration and distortion. HYBRID O.I.S. image stabilization further benefits working in difficult lighting conditions by minimizing the appearance of camera shake across five distinct axes. The lens also utilizes a linear AF motor, that is benefitted by LUMIX Depth From Defocus technology to achieve fast focusing performance throughout the zoom range. The bridge-style design of this camera features both an electronic viewfinder and rear LCD monitor for easier viewing in an array of working situations. The 0.39\" 2,359k-dot OLED Live View Finder provides 100% frame coverage with 35mm-equivalent 0.7x magnification while the 3.0\" 921k-dot LCD monitor features a free-angle, articulating design to facilitate working from high and low angles.

Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight.

High-speed steel (HSS) provides hardness for wear resistance, and the black oxide finish acts as a lubricant to reduce wear while promoting chip and coolant flow. These jobber length drill bits have a drilling depth up to four times their diameter. The round shank accommodates most drill chucks. The set comes in a metal index case with labeled compartments for identification and organization. Drill bits conform to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards.', 'Drill bits are cutting tools used to make holes in a range of materials using machines such as handheld portable drills, machining centers, and lathes. Drill bits come in a variety of lengths and types, the most common of which is the twist drill bit. The round, twisted shaft of the twist drill bit typically has two cutting edges and flutes. The helical twist of the flutes brings chips up and away from the cutting edges and allows for coolant to reach the cutting edges. Jobber length twist drill bits, the most common length of twist drill bit, offer a good compromise of length and reach to work with the widest range of materials and applications. Mechanic\\'s length twist drill bits (also called maintenance length) are a little shorter than jobber length and less prone to deflection when drilling. Short length twist drill bits (also called stub or screw-machine length) are the shortest and stiffest twist drill bits, helping to reduce the chance of deflection or breakage when drilling. Reduced shank drill bits (also called Silver and Deming drill bits) have a shank that is smaller in diameter than its shaft, permitting drilling machines with either a 1/2\" or 3/4\" drill chuck to create large holes. Long length twist drill bits (also called taper length) are a little longer than jobber length, allowing for deeper holes and longer reach. Extra long twist drill bits (also called extension) are longer than long length twist drill bits for greater reach or for drilling deeper holes.', 'Dormer Pramet manufactures cutting tools under the following brands: Precision Twist Drill, Dormer, Union Butterfield and Pramet.

This \u2018bokeh\u2019 effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. \u03b1 lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.', 'ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass', 'As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration.', 'Aspherical lens elements', 'Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion.

The Dayton Audio subwoofer amplifier is based on a state-of-the-art Class-G circuit topology that combines the proven high power, high fidelity characteristics of a Class-AB amplifier with a patented tracking down converter power supply to achieve an operating efficiency up to 86%. You get the efficiency of a Class-D amplifier without compromising audio quality and reliability. The Class-AB output stage provides the clean and low-distortion sound that audiophiles demand, without any of the instability problems that plague other high-efficiency amplifier designs. This American-designed and engineered amplifier uses patented circuitry that continuously tracks the input signal to modulate or control the voltage available to the output stage. This \"tracking\" capability delivers the exact amount of power based on demand instead of constantly keeping it in reserve, so the output stage only draws the amount of power that is required at any given time. Less energy is wasted as heat, and more power is available for the subwoofer driver. With its enhanced thermal management, the is an upgrade over previous models\u2014making it a nearly bulletproof amplifier choice for todays demanding HT audio and music playback applications.

For example leather has been added to underside of the handle to make carrying the bag more comfortable. The shoulder sling has also been upgraded to be fully removable. A luggage trolley retainer strap has been added to the back to aid while travelling. Further, the rear zipped pocket now features an upgraded weather-proof zipper. Like the 'Hadley Pro', it comes with an identically sized removable padded insert (with a padded lid) that protects the contents on all six sides. Included are 4 padded dividers - two vertical dividers and two small hinged dividers, perfect for stacking lenses. To safeguard contents from the elements, the main top flap of the Hadley Pro 2020 is sculpted around the opening to prevent rain or unwanted fingers getting into the bag. Further protection is afforded by Billingham\ufffds purpose-built hard wearing Canvas or even harder wearing FibreNyte fabric - neither material ever requires reproofing, maintaining their waterproof properties throughout the life of the bag.
