Model \u2026 ['Bathtub shower screens are a sleek alternative to shower curtains and sliding shower doors. They are common in Europe and feature a glass panel attached to the wall by one or more hinges, enabling the glass to swing rather than slide. Ark Showers has taken this European bath screen design and optimized it for US bathrooms. All our shower screens feature 5/16 inch (8mm) tempered safety glass which gives a solid feel without being too heavy. This model features high-clarity low iron glass which minimizes the green tint which can be seen when regular clear glass is viewed along its length. This, combined with the fact that there is no hardware (rods, rails or hinges) other than at the wall helps to make your bathroom feel larger. Ark shower screens come in a range of designs, sizes and finishes to suit all tastes. They are hygienic and easy to clean and last for years. For ease of cleaning, the glass is also coated with ClearShield, a hydrophobic coating applied to both faces. ClearShield is a polymeric resin that bonds chemically with the glass to form a hydrophobic (water heating) coating on the surface of the glass. The coating is inert, transparent and non-hazardous but it causes the water droplets to bead up and run off the glass more readily than they do on ordinary glass, leaving less water behind (and any soap, lime scale or other residues). Consequently, far less cleaning is required to keep your shower screen looking like new, saving you time and effort.'] [\"European 'swing-door' design, brushed nickel hardware finish\", '60 inches high by 30 inches wide', '5/16 inches (8mm) crystal clear safety tempered glass with ClearShield coating on both sides', 'Square glass top corner for a contemporary look', 'Shipped complete with all necessary mounting hardware and bottom and wall seals'] {\"Brand\": \"Ark Showers\", \"Color\": \"Clear Glass, Polished Chrome hardware\", \"Material\": \"Solid Brass Hinges, Low Iron Tempered Glass\", \"Style\": \"Square Corner\", \"Item Weight\": \"54 Pounds\", \"Assembly Required\": \"Yes\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Ark Showers\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"30 x 2 x 60 inches\", \"Country of Origin\": \"China\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Finish\": \"Polished Chrome\", \"Shape\": \"square\", \"Item Package Quantity\": \"1\", \"Special Features\": \"Low iron (high-clarity) glass\", \"Included Components\": \"Frameless Bathtub Shower Door, Seals, Hardware Pack\", \"Warranty Description\": \"3 year manufacturer\", \"Date First Available\": \"August 14, 2015\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Channel 1 Accepts L/R RCA type unbalanced consumer line level inputs, electronically balances the signal, amplifies it to pro-sound line level, and supplies it to two male XLR output connections. Channel 2 Accepts L/R XLR balanced inputs, electronically converts them to two unbalanced channels, and provides attenuated signal to L/R RCA outputs. Both channel 1 and 2 include level controls for fine adjustment of each pair. Note: The advantage of higher gain, balanced audio signals with pro-sound gear is its immunity to induced noise and interference. Since the signal is balanced on two lines, any interference that is introduced on the line is cancelled out at the destination. Additionally, the higher signal level insures better signal-to-noise ratio on the line.

The Istanbul brand name was adopted by a cymbal works established by two cymbal smiths, Mehmet Tamdeger and Agop Tomurcuk. At that time, they had over three decades of cymbal making experience. Mehmet and Agop named their company after the city that has been home to the epitome of high quality cymbals for many, many years: Istanbul. These cymbals were first exported to the U.S. in 1984, first under the name \"Zildjiler\", and soon afterwards as \"Istanbul\". Both craftsmen signed each cymbal and many of these cymbals are now collectors\\' items. After Agop Tomurcuk\\'s unexpected death in July 1996, Mehmet decided to continue the production of cymbals under his own name, \u0130stanbul Mehmet. A lot has changed since then, but his belief in the richness and the character of a handmade cymbal will always remain. Machines don\\'t have ears.

The bright f/2 maximum aperture makes this lens especially useful for astrophotography and low-light use, and when paired with the 5.9\" minimum focusing distance, distinct shallow depth of field imagery can also be produced. The optical construction includes three extra-low dispersion elements and two aspherical elements to control both chromatic and spherical aberrations for greater sharpness, clarity, and reduced color fringing. A Frog Eye Coating has been applied, too, to repel dust and moisture from the front element of the lens to benefit working in trying environmental conditions. Additionally, the manual aperture ring can be de-clicked for smooth, silent aperture changes to suit video applications, and the front of the lens is threaded to accept 72mm screw-in filters. Ultra wide-angle prime is designed for full-frame Canon RF-mount mirrorless cameras. Relatively fast f/2 maximum aperture benefits astrophotography and low-light shooting applications. Rectilinear design renders subjects with minimal distortion in order to suit landscape and architectural applications. Three extra-low dispersion elements reduce chromatic aberrations and color fringing for increased clarity and color neutrality. Two aspherical elements are also featured to limit spherical aberrations for improved sharpness. A Frog Eye Coating has been applied to repel both dust and moisture for added protection when working in inclement conditions. Manual focus design permits working with subjects as close as 5.9\" away with a maximum magnification ratio of 1:4. The manual aperture ring can be mechanically de-clicked for smooth, silent rotation throughout the aperture range; making it ideal for video applications.

Beyond giving the CM10GD its distinctive profile, Bosch's Axial-Glide system eliminates three key challenges miter saw users have endured since the first slide systems debuted many years ago. While the traditional sliding compound miter saw approach enables users to make wider cross cuts, that system takes up more space and is prone to misalignment and stickiness over time. By replacing the sliding rail system with a hinged or articulating glide arm system - similar to the linkage used in a four-bar suspension design - Bosch created a more compact miter saw that delivers durable precision, remaining true and smooth over time. The Bosch CM10GD 10-Inch Dual Bevel Glide Miter Saw features a powerful 15-Amp, 4, 000-RPM motor with large easy-to-read bevel and miter scales allowing for precise, quick and easy adjustments: 52-Degree Left/60-Degree Right Miter Capacity; 47-Degree Left/47-Degree Right Bevel Capacity with marked detents and roof pitch angles. The tall sliding 4-1/4-Inch fences allow for increased cutting capacity when cutting tall base and crown moulding. With an ergonomic soft-grip ambidextrous trigger handle and a clear lower guard for unobstructed visibility throughout cut, the CM10GD provides maximum comfort for all-day use.Bosch MS1233 Crown Stop Kit for Bosch Miter Saws, Includes Mounting Knobs and HardwareThe Bosch MS1233 Crown Stop Kit for Miter Saws allows for crown molding to be nested against fence for simple miter cuts.

This (fire retardant, lead-free) puncture-proof PVC material is approximately 5 times stronger than nylon used in lesser-quality units. The PVC will not tear, fade, get moldy, and is far easier to clean. Additional belting reinforcements are found at key stress points, and heavy-duty, multilayer stitching is used throughout. An impressive 30\" tall mattress provides excellent spring force and cushioning that allows for tall leaps and comfortable landings. The roof shields children from the sun and features a safety escape hatch to exit in the event deflation occurs during a power failure. The wide, elevated front slide is a safe way to exit this bouncer rather than accidentally bouncing and falling out of the house. The large mesh windows are made from ripstop netting and won\\'t tear like inferior mesh materials. The mesh netting also allows children to be supervised. Zippered flaps allow the bouncer to be quickly deflated and taken down for storage.

Maple takes care of most of the work, Hemp smooths out top and low ends, while Cocobolo adds that extra punch. Together the sound the woods produce, when combined with our special processes, are full-bodied, dynamic, and truly defined. X Series Drivers - The RS1x is the first headphone to be built with the larger 50mm X Drivers. Specifically tuned for the tri-wood RS1x, this new speaker design features a more powerful magnetic circuit, a voice coil with decreased effective mass, and a reconfigured diaphragm. Reengineering these components for our 50mm drivers improve efficiency, reduces distortion, and preserves the harmonic integrity of your music. New Cable & Headbands - Along with the speakers, the cables and headband have been redesigned for the RS1x. Housed in a more durable exterior, the new super annealed copper 8-conductor cable reveals even more of your music with improved purity. The new black leather headband features a white-stitched accent. Our first wooden headphones were built in the middle of the night back in 1994, wood has been a staple on our workbench ever since. Each RS1x headphone is hand-assembled by our team in Brooklyn - these headphones go from workbench to workbench until they\u2019re ready for your ears.'] ['The new 50mm dynamic drivers are specifically tuned for the tri-wood RS1x, this new speaker design features a more powerful magnetic circuit, a voice coil with decreased effective mass, and a reconfigured diaphragm', 'Housed in a more durable braided exterior, the new super annealed copper 8-conductor cable reveals even more of your music with improved purity.

The FUSION technology built into the adapter enables electronic communication between mixed lens and camera platforms. FUSION adapters enable auto focus, aperture control, image stabilization, and more. Different lenses may exhibit different operating characteristics depending on lens age and manufacturer, we recommend testing individual lenses in your setup before critical shoots. The Vizelex ND Throttle is well known for having a built-in variable neutral density filter that offers 1 to 8 stops of light reduction. This concept in adapters has been praised by film makers and now Fotodiox has optimized the adapter for that same crowd. The new Vizelex Cine ND Throttle now feature a geared rotating ring for more precise ND selections and can be used with follow focus accessories.Fotodiox adapters are manufactured with precise tolerances, providing a solid, gap free, no wiggle connection for stress free use with chrome plated brass mounts for enhanced durability and reliability.

Some lenses will have slow auto focus, or no auto focus at all. (especially third party lenses)Switching between image and video can cause camera to freeze.

Standard. Stock. Some words were never intended to describe your truck, and it takes a certain type of hardworking truck accessory to meet your expectations. The Prowler Max grille guard equips your truck to tackle the toughest of jobs with its uncommon construction, comprehensive protection and arsenal of extra features. It begins with a bold, punched steel screen center section. This heavy-gauge mesh not only adds style to the Prowler Max but also increases protection for your grille, shielding it from rocks, debris and other threats. The center section features our signature logo reveal with contoured horizontal tubes to add even more protection and increase structural stability. Below the center section is a built-in 4\" wide step with non-skid, diamond treads. The step blends perfectly with the grille guard and provides easier access when working under the hood, particularly on large, full-size pickup trucks. The Prowler Max grille guard also distinguishes itself with its vehicle-specific wraparound ring assembly. The double-stacked side brush guards uniquely contour to the front end of each truck application and feature 3/8\" wires for increased headlight protection. This particular custom truck grille guard fits specific years of the Ford Expedition (see fitment info to verify). To give it the muscle to stand behind its attitude, we construct the Prowler Max from one-piece, 2\" diameter tubular steel. Its heavy-duty uprights bolt directly to the frame of the truck, using high-strength steel brackets and a no-drill installation (NOTE: Brackets for attaching this grille guard are included but shipped separately). To finish things off, the Prowler Max truck grille guard is available in two finish options. The E-coat and black powder coat finish offers maximum durability, while the high-polish stainless steel provides a bright, no-rust shine.'] ['MAX .

Only by delivering all this, can we proudly state that the all-new Pocket Memo is taking dictation to the next level. 3D MIC SYSTEM FOR BEST AUDIO The breakthrough 3D Mic technology uses the built-in microphones to always deliver best recording results: an omnidirectional microphone offering 360 degree sound pick-up, ideal for the recording of multiple sound sources such as meetings, and a unidirectional microphone optimized for voice recording and accurate speech-recognition results. MOTION SENSOR The built-in motion sensor senses when the device is placed on the desk or held in the hand and selects the microphone accordingly to suit the recording situation. The motion sensor switches automatically into standby mode when the device is idle. Once the Pocket Memo is picked up again, it's ready to record within seconds.

This disc achieves a higher cut-rate, greater durability, and longer life than other fiber discs \u2014 all with less grinding pressure.', 'From the Manufacturer', '3M Cubitron II Fibre Disc 987C is suitable for use on almost all metals and excels in stainless steel and other nickel alloy applications. It is ideal for weld removal, beveling, removing mill scale, pits and imperfections, and more. Because 3M Precision Shaped Grain generates an exceptionally high cut-rate with less pressure, operators can finish tough tasks faster and with less fatigue. A grinding aid incorporated on the disc makes this an outstanding product for all types of metal\u2014it helps keep the disc cooler on stainless steel and heat-sensitive metals such as nickel alloys and titanium, thereby reducing metal discoloration/oxidation and the chance of heat-related stress cracks. Moreover, because the abrasive itself stays cooler and sharper, 3M Precision Shaped Grain discs last significantly longer than conventional ceramic grain discs, delivering a lower cost per grind with fewer disc changes.', '3M Cubitron II products have raised the bar for high-performing abrasives. 3M Precision Shaped Grain outcuts and outlasts conventional ceramic industrial abrasives and requires less grinding force to achieve superior performance. The result is that operators can grind faster and complete more parts per disc with less muscle-work and fatigue.', 'To create 3M Precision Shaped Grain, engineers started with 3M Ceramic Abrasive Grain and used proprietary technology to form the grains into triangular structures and electrostatically orient them on the backing to form sharp peaks that maximize cutting potential. These peaks slice cleanly through metal, rather than gouging or plowing as traditional abrasives do, and continuously self-sharpen as the points break off. This generates a super-fast cut and lessens heat build-up due to friction, reducing heat-related stress cracks and discoloration.', '3M Precision Shaped Grain also wears evenly, and because the abrasive itself stays cooler and sharper, 3M Cubitron II products last significantly longer than their conventional ceramic counterparts, ensuring extended high performance in production applications.', 'Fiber discs are heavy-duty discs ideal for weld removal, grinding, and blending large and small areas of metal surfaces. They feature a tough, stiff backing made from vulcanized fiber that resist wear and can handle tough grinding applications.'] ['3M Precision-Shaped Grain maintains super-sharp points that cut exceptionally fast with less pressure', 'Mineral runs cooler and disc life is significantly longer, completing more parts per disc and requiring fewer disc changes', 'Reduces changeouts and downtime in robotic and pressure-assisted applications', 'Stiff fiber backing and a strong resin bond provide durability and tear-resistance for heavyweight applications such as high-pressure weld grinding or beveling', 'Grinding aid incorporated on the disc minimizes grinding temperatures for heat-sensitive alloys', '3M Precision Shaped Grain (PSG) maintains super-sharp points that cut exceptionally fast with less pressure', 'PSG runs cooler and disc life is significantly longer, completing more parts per disc and requiring fewer disc changes', 'Stiff fiber backing and a strong resin bond provide durability and tear-resistance for heavyweight applications such as high-pressure weld grinding or beveling', 'Grinding aid incorporated on the disc minimizes grinding temperatures for heat-sensitive alloys'] {\"Grit Material\": \"Ceramic\", \"Item Diameter\": \"5 Inches\", \"Br"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The new AT-1000ProII keeps many of the same features of the previous model, but simplifies the operation. With the two position antenna switch there are 2,000 memories that store tuning parameters for almost instantaneous memory recall whenever you transmit on or near a frequency you\u2019ve used before. Just key and it tunes! The AT-1000ProII will operate at any power level between 5 and 1,000 watts peak RF input. The AT-1000ProII has a large, easy to read bargraph with two selectable scale ranges (100 and 1,000 watts) as well as SWR meter. The AT-1000ProII will interface with many popular transceivers, enabling their TUNE button to control the AT-1000ProII\u2019s operation. Dedicated control buttons allow you to fine-tune capacitance and inductance on those rare occasions when the AT-1000ProII can\u2019t find a perfect match by itself. The AT-1000ProII will tune from 1.8 to 54.0 MHz continuously, and will match an amazing range of antennas, from Yagis and dipoles to inverted-Vs and slopers; virtually any coax-fed antenna from 6 to 1000 ohms impedance (16 \u2013 150 ohms on 6 meters). Tuning time is usually under 10 seconds. If you\u2019re transmitting near a frequency with stored tuning parameters, it will set those parameters in under 0.2 seconds.

The Sonzera 20 is a 20-watt combo amplifier with two independently controlled, foot switchable channels designed for maximum versatility and in the spirit of vintage amps that allowed you to control your tone instead of the amp being in control. The clean channel delivers full, 3D tones reminiscent of American 1960\u2019s and 70\u2019s amplifiers. The lead channel is related to the clean channel circuit-wise, so that it can be set up to act as a boosted clean channel or manipulated to make the channels sound like two completely different amps (the lead channel can be set from slight to very heavy distortion by simply using the volume and master controls). The bright switch on the lead channel has been carefully tailored to deliver familiar high-end snap and is particularly effective on the low strings, neck pickup settings, and with single coils, while the low-end response of the lead channel is full, tight, and clear. Both channels on the Sonzera are designed to maximize note clarity and definition. The global presence control and the tone stack allow players to dial in a variety of tones from bell-like chime to warmer, thicker tones. The Sonzera 20 Combo also features global reverb control that is designed to enhance notes without clouding them. The reverb can be turned on and off via the footswitch. The addition of a built-in effects loop allows players to use all their time-based effects with ease without negatively impacting the overall tone of the amp. In addition to its versatile tone, the Sonzera 20 Combo is also designed for reliability and serviceability. The power tube sockets are mounted directly to the steel chassis, and no push-on connections are used - all wires are soldered. With robust construction, a wide range of tones, and steadfast controllability, the Sonzera 20 Combo is a solid gig- and studio- worthy amplifier.'] ['20-Watt combo amplifier', 'Short-Bottle 6L6 Power Tubes', 'Grab and go combo', '1x12 Celestin v-type speaker', 'Includes 2-button footswitch (channel gain/clean, reverb on/off)'] {\"Item Weight\": \"48.25 Pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"24 x 15 x 23 inches\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"February 18, 2017\", \"Color Name\": \"Black\", \"Material Type\": \"Lead\", \"Output Wattage\": \"20 Watts\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Brand\": \"PRS Guitars\", \"Color\": \"Black\", \"Material\": \"Lead\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The 9MP camera has a CMOS color sensor, a reduction lens, image capture and editing software, and USB 2.0 output to capture or display still or video images on a computer or projector. The trinocular head has a Siedentopf binocular mount with 53 to 77mm interpupillary adjustment, a fixed 30-degree vertical inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and a 360-degree rotation capability to provide a more comprehensive view and enable sharing. The 23mm vertical trinocular port can be used to mount the camera. Dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. The forward-facing nosepiece has 4x, 10x, 40xS (spring), and 100xS (spring, oil) DIN achromatic objectives that combine with the eyepieces to provide color correction of magnified images at eight magnifications. The 40xS objective is spring loaded to prevent slide damage when focusing. The 100xS spring-loaded oil objective provides increased resolution over a standard objective.

The Mix and Reverb knobs control the mix of dry/wet signal and the decay of the reverb, respectively. The Speed and Depth knobs correspond with the selected modulation mode: Flange, Filter or Tremolo. The Procession has two footswitches. The Bypass switch is your standard on/off True Bypass switch. The Hold switch is a momentary footswitch that when pressed, will lock in whatever note is being played through the reverb effect. This will sustain as long as the Hold switch is pressed.

The WA76 has a fully discrete signal path and uses the original Reichenbach Engineering's (now CineMag) transformer design. The classic '76 was a major breakthrough in limiter technology, and used on hundreds of hit records since its inception. Engineers have craved the ultra-fast attack time and trademark sound of the '76 for decades, and now it is finally affordable! Our goal was to make a compressor of this pedigree affordable for the first time, without compromising the quality and design parameters that make this type of compressor so desirable. All Buttons In The WA76 can reproduce the classic effect known as \u2018All Buttons In\u2019 mode, sometimes also referred to as \u2018British Mode\u2019 or the \u2018Four Button Trick\u2019. Originally an accident due to the mechanical nature of the interconnected latching switches, this mode is reproduced by pushing in all four ratio buttons simultaneously and getting them to latch. This can take a bit of practice. The resulting compression curve is aggressive and unmistakably unique, and can be heard on the drum tracks of many classic recordings. All-buttons-in compression is typically characterized by having a very aggressive compression ratio, attack and release curves that are more drastic plateaus opposed to gentler slopes, and more audible distortion or \u2018overdrive\u2019 on the signal. Initial transients are more likely to come through loudly, followed by heavy compression curve sometimes described as having a \u2018sucking\u2019 effect as the compressor releases. Because this mode is considered a design accident, faithfully maintained; it is normal for the meter function to \u2018peg out\u2019 and cease providing accurate metering. Premium Components We have faithfully reproduced the circuitry of the revision D, generally considered one of the best and most popular among the different versions made over the years. We\u2019ve used all discrete, through-hole components, high quality CineMag input and output transformers, and a class A circuit that stays true to the legacy design.\"] ['Single channel discrete compressor', 'Custom CineMag USA Transformers', 'True to the Classic \u201876 compressor in design and performance', 'Fully discrete signal path', 'Supports the famous \u201call buttons in\u201d ratio setting'] {\"Brand\": \"Warm Audio\", \"Voltage\": \"24 Volts\", \"Recommended Uses For Product\": \"Drilling, Air Brushing, Spraying, Nailing\", \"Noise Level\": \"74 dB\", \"Included Components\": \"IEC Cable, Owners Manual\", \"Item Weight\": \"8.9 pounds\", \"Maximum Power\": \"0.2 Horsepower\", \"Color\": \"Black\", \"Style\": \"Classic\", \"Model Name\": \"WA76\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"1.1\\\"L x 9.7\\\"W x 6.5\\\"H\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"February 10, 2014\", \"Color Name\": \"Black\", \"Signal Format\": \"Analog\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

AF 135mm F1.8 FE Key Features Superb Resolution Unsparing application of Samyang's most advanced optical technologies has produced a large-aperture prime telephoto lens that delivers outstanding corner-to-corner resolution. The AF 135mm F1.8 FE delivers an 18.9\u02da angle of view for full-frame and 12.5\u02da for APS-C. It features a bright maximum aperture of F1.8 throughout the entire image, as favoured by full-frame camera users. In particular, optimum resolution is achieved through the optical design of 13 elements in 11 groups (1 U-ASP, 2 HR and 3 ED). Combined with Sony's full-frame image sensor, this lens delivers superior sharpness and contrast in all areas of the image. Able to deliver extremely narrow depth of field, with beautiful bokeh The AF 135mm F1.8 FE uses a large-diameter aperture to provide smooth background blur. It effectively allows separation of the subject from the background, by using a shallow depth of field. Also, it is equipped with a UA (Ultra-precision Aspherical) lens, which delivers natural and refined bokeh. Using this smooth bokeh, you can freely create images highlighting your subjects against stunning backgrounds, whether shooting portraits, close-ups or even cityscapes. Fast and Quiet Auto Focus Performance Tracking the subject accurately and quickly, the AF also operates quietly and smoothly when shooting video. Samyang's Linear STM (Stepping Motor) satisfies both photographers and videographers with quieter and more accurate control of the focusing lens groups. Enhanced Operability and Reliability Important features include customisable: A Focus Hold button, Custom Switch and Focus Range Limiter. Overall, this is a lens that meets or exceeds professional requirement for control and reliability for both stills and movies. 1) Focus Hold Button Pressing this button on the lens will keep the lens locked to that focusing distance. You can assign functions such as Eye AF in settings on the camera body. 2) Custom Switch There is a custom switch, which can be set to allow adjustment of the aperture silently by rotating the focus ring. Using the optional Lens Station, you can set up the mode to suit your own preference. (More functions will be added through firmware updates in the future.) 3) Focus Range Limiter switch The Focus Range Limiter only operates in AF mode. It is useful when the distance from an object has been determined. Move the Focus Range Limiter forward or backward to select the focus range. - FULL: The AF range is set to infinity at a minimum focus distance of 0.69m.

These trucks were born in an era of basics for GM, but you can fix the front end with a set of the XB Hybrids from Morimoto. With a high-performance Bi-LED projector and a full LED daytime running light, these headlights will deliver some much needed modernization in the performance and style department for the front-end of your Yukon. The XB Hybrids share many of the same core components developed for a lot of the more expensive lights from Morimoto, without some of the features that make them considerably more expensive. That said... these new Yukon LED headlights are hardly a compromise. True light-pipe driven optics for the DRL. Killer light output. Good Looks... all wrapped up inside of an OEM-grade housing and backed with a solid five-year warranty. When it comes to light output, these Yukon headlights wont disappoint at all because there is no lack of luminosity here. the Hybrids have a powerful, wide, and bright Bi-LED projector that produces an amazing low and high beam pattern despite the affordable price point. Their Bi-LED projector optics also meet & exceed all SAE, DOT, and regulations. they come out of the box aimed to factory specs, and are also fully adjustable for those of you with lifted (or slammed) Yukons. When it comes to wiring, it doesn't get much easier than this. The Hybrid headlights are designed to work on your Yukon without any modifications at all. They will plug into the factory H13 three-pin connector for the stock headlights, and will work seamlessly without any issues at all.

The Hood LED Light Bar Kit for the 2018-2019 Jeep Wrangler from Diode Dynamics allows you to easily mount a 50 Inch light bar across the hood. These application-specific brackets were CAD-designed to install using factory mounting points. No cutting or drilling required! When installed along with our fully-customizable JL Wrangler Cowl Mount Brackets, you can easily mount multiple pods on either side of the 50 Inch light bar as well. Low profile. These L-shaped brackets were designed in-house specifically for our Stage Series light bar. They were designed to be low profile and won't block visibility while driving or block the wiper nozzles. This also means you won't hear whistling or major wind noise like you may have experienced with other light bar brackets. Not your average hardware. The hardware included with this kit is OEM-style, automotive grade hardware. This hardware isn't from the hardware store - it was custom designed for this kit with integrated washers and the same OEM finish as the factory hardware. The Delrin spacers are long-lasting and won't wear over time. Control through aux switch bank. Included with the full light bar kit is our new OEM Auxiliary Switch Dual-Output Wiring Harness. This harness allows you to control your auxiliary lighting using the factory-installed aux switch bank. For those who don't have the aux switch bank, our Heavy Duty Dual-Output Wiring Harness is also included to mount a switch and connect directly to the battery. Designed for performance. You may think that you'll get lots of glare from light bouncing off the hood. However, thanks to custom-engineering TIR optics, Diode Dynamics Stage Series LED light bars shine light in a highly-functional and useful beam pattern, much more focused than older LEDs on the market. The Driving optic easily shines right over the hood, even with the low mounting position. Functional Patterns. All Stage Series beam pattern options were designed with optical simulation modeling, to shape the output in a highly-functional beam pattern. No matter what your auxiliary lighting needs are, there is a Stage Series optic for you! The Driving pattern was designed to supplement your high beams. Rather than a simple spot pattern, the Stage Series Driving pattern has a rectangular 20Wx8H degree pattern that is far more useful for directing light downrange at high speeds. The Flood pattern was designed to provide uniform, even illumination and a full 80Wx50H degree spread of light. Unlike generic flood light optics that are simply a heavily diffused spot, our flood optic is a true optically designed spread, resulting in the biggest spread in the industry! It is perfect for lighting up anything at low speeds, a backup or reverse light, or to light up a worksite. The Combo pattern combines both the Driving and Flood optics. It shines light downrange in a focused, rectangular 20Wx8H degree pattern while also illuminating area around it in a full 80Wx50H degree spread.

Use the microscope for studying fixed or live cells, bacteria, plants and soil, or water samples. Viewing Head To customize the microscope to your viewing comfort, the eyepiece spacing can be easily adjusted using a precision Siedentopf mechanism. A diopter is available on the left ocular tube to compensate for asymmetry, and the ocular tubes are angled at 30\u00c2\u00b0 to comfortably accommodate a seated position without neck strain. Various eyepieces can be used to increase the overall optical magnification. The trinocular photo-port adds a dedicated mounting tube for cameras. The 23mm tube is height-adjustable to fine-tune the focus to match the eyepieces. The Stage The 2-layer mechanical stage provides smooth and precise movement for examination of specimen slides. The stage's low-position controls are conveniently placed near the coaxial focus knobs for a streamlined workflow. Examining specimen slides is intuitive and precise for users at any skill level. Transmitted Illumination The LED sub-stage lighting provides cool, energy-efficient illumination. The light-source is daylight balanced to produce natural colors for imaging.

The high resonant peak makes for a sparkly top end and an incredible \u201cbloom\u201d on chords in high-gain situations. The responsive and accurate pick attack ensures that you will cut through any live mix, and will have tight-tracking transients in a studio environment. Because the Pegasus is a moderate output pickup, it works as well for clean tones as it does for distorted tones. The Sentient neck delivers a balanced, versatile tone that fits right between the \u201959 model and the Jazz neck pickup. You\u2019ll get pristine cleans and fluid leads under high gain. The Sentient is a very articulate vintage output pickup with great dynamic response and a wide harmonic range. It works great for low tunings in all humbucker-equipped guitars.

The only thing missing from the HFN-C in a classical is the \\'quack\\' that everyone has come to expect and accept in classical acoustic pickups. As well, there is nothing artificial about the sound of the HFN-C\\'s and the usual under the saddle sound is replaced with the actual acoustic sound of the instrument. The HFN-C piezo sensing unit fits inside the instrument and spans the center brace or reinforcement strip. Due its\\' design, this series of pickups produces sound much closer to that of a good microphone than any under the saddle pickup or bridge replacement pickup that you\\'ve ever heard. Artist II Preamp The HFN-C Artist pickups include the new Artist II preamp, a high quality dual channel preamp built right into the endpin jack. This pickup can be used with or without an external preamp/eq/mixer, or can be plugged directly into your amp or PA system. The Artist II preamp is a dual channel preamp with the HFN pickup wired to one channel. The other channel is available for a second pickup, such as a magnetic pickup. Trim pots are provided to control the gain for each channel separately to allow balancing of the signals from two pickups. The signals are then blended into a pre-mixed mono output.'] ['Works with All Nylon-string Guitars', 'Active System, Includes Artist II Preamp', 'Can be Remotely Powered', 'Easy to Install', 'Full Two-year Warranty'] {\"Item Weight\": \"3.2 ounces\", \"Package Dimensions\": \"5.4 x 3.6 x 1.3 inches\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"August 26, 2009\", \"Body Material\": \"Plastic\", \"Compatible Devices\": \"Guitar\", \"Guitar Pickup Configuration\": \"Piezo\", \"String Material\": \"Nylon\", \"Number of Strings\": \"6\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Brand\": \"Schatten Design\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}
