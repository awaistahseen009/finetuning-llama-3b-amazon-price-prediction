Easy to use. The product is manufactured in China.', 'Amazon.com', \"Hands down, Milwaukee's Magnums have the best power-to-weight ratio and more torque than any other drill in their class\\x97-and more power and less weight means a faster, easier job for you. The dual range speed control is phenomenal; pair either of the speed ranges with high or low torque to exactly match the size of the bit and the material you're drilling into. The variable speed switches are smooth; the large, two-finger trigger and grips are ergonomically designed to feel great in your hand and offer optimum comfort and balance. The auxiliary handle adjusts easily, and its depth guide slides nicely and secures tightly for accurate repetition. In hammer-drill mode, this model's aggressive and powerful, offering up to an awesome 50,000 blows per minute, blowing away even the densest masonry. Be sure to use the best carbide bits you can afford, though, because a cheap bit is a waste on a great hammer drill like this. If we had to choose our favorite feature, it might well be the spare carbon brushes that store right in the handle for instant, on-the-job maintenance. As soon as you notice you're losing power, just change out the carbon brushes (it took us less than a minute) and you're back on the job. This chuck is keyed, and we know some of you are keyless fans, but don't let that keep you away from this fantastic piece of machinery. Like all of Milwaukee's goods, this one's made well, with high impact-resistant motor housings that will survive the roughest jobsite and rubber cords that stay flexible no matter the weather.\", '--Kris Jensen-Van Heste', 'From the Manufacturer', \"For small hole drilling up to 1/2-inch the Milwaukee Magnum Hammer-Drill is all the tool you'll need.

Use Rotation with Hammering when drilling in concrete. Dual Range Speed Control allows the operator to choose higher speed with lower torque or slower speed and more torque depending on the size and type of the fastener or bit and the material being drilled. This tool can be used to drive concrete screw fasteners used in many installation operations. The Magnum offers a unique Brush Cartridge System, storing spare carbon brushes in the handle of the tool. Only a screwdriver is needed to replace worn brushes.

The vertical trinocular port can be used to mount the camera. The Siedentopf binocular head has 48 to 75mm interpupillary adjustment, fixed 30-degree vertical inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation capability to provide a more comprehensive view and enable sharing. Bilateral dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences.

Featuring an 8-channel NVR and six 4K Smart Active Deterrence IP secuirty cameras, this system will provide high-quality 4K recordings and the smartest features to protect your property.The NVR also includes a large 2TB hard drive for private local recording with no monthly fees and is easily connected to our Lorex Home App for easy remote viewing and motion notifications. As part of the Lorex Fusion collection, you can add up to two Lorex Wi-Fi products to open channels, as well as accessory alarm sensors. If you are looking to protect your home, small business or commercial property, this powerful security camera system will have you covered. Thanks to the camera's powerful 8MP image sensor, you'll experience the difference that 4K resolution makes when it comes to your security. 4K means there are more than 8 million pixels, which results in sharper video and realistic color representation. Perfect for front doors and entranceways, Face Detection will only notify you of motion events when a face has been detected. This prevents motion notifications from people or vehicles simply passing by and not coming towards the camera. You can also easily preview all the different faces that the camera has captured for quick reference. You can also review and filter only face detection events in Smart Search. Smart Person and Vehicle Detection helps identify more important objects that enter the camera's field of view.

The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-90x. The 1.3MP camera has a CMOS color sensor, a reduction lens, image capture and editing software, and USB 2.0 output to capture or display still or video images on a computer or projector. The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port. The WH10x20mm super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces combine with the 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective to provide continuous zoom magnification and a longer working distance for inspecting large-scale specimens that require handling or repair. The microscope comes with 0.5x and 2.0x Barlow lenses that can be added to the objective to increase the magnification range. A Barlow lens with a magnification of less than 1.0 reduces magnification and increases the working distance, while a Barlow lens with a magnification greater than 1.0 increases the magnification and reduces the working distance. High-eyepoint eyepieces ease viewing for users who wear glasses, and dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. A digital stereo microscope, sometimes called an inspection or dissection microscope, has low magnification and a long working distance that enables users to manipulate the object being inspected, and is used where image capture, detailed records, or documentation is required.', 'The 1.3MP digital camera has a CMOS color sensor for displaying still microscopy images and streaming live videos to a computer or projector. The camera has 40x magnification and a 0.37x reduction lens that ensures that the display has a similar field of view as the microscope eyepiece. The camera can be mounted in a C-Mount or any 23mm eye tube. The camera includes image capture and editing software that provides still image and live video capture and editing capability, including measurement functions. The software supports JPG, TIF, GIF, PSD, WMF, and BMP file formats and is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8; Mac OS X; and Linux. Camera drivers are compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8; Mac OS X; and Linux.

The circuit is a transformerless design, which allows the sound of the capsule to pass through without creating distortion or noise. Each Mini K47 is hand-built and tuned to minimize distortion. We perform a 7-step QC process on each: testing for noise, distortion, polarity/phase, microphonics, frequency response, sensitivity, and cosmetic finish. Every mic spends a minimum of 24 hours on our proprietary \"burn-in\" rack to ensure that the components are fully conditioned. Every mic undergoes audio sweep testing (20-20kHz swept sine wave using a custom calibrated speaker) to ensure that it meets our high performance standards. The Mini K47 has a heavy steel body, finished with a baked-on black metallic powdercoating that is extremely durable. The \"Cutaway[tm]\" shockmount has a metal frame, and low-resonance O-rings. To create Matched Stereo Pairs of the Mini K47, we run 10-20 microphones at a time through a frequency sweep analysis. Then we handpick pairs based on both sensitivity (0.5dB maximum delta, measured at 1kHz) and frequency response (within 1.5dB, 50Hz - 15kHz). This is a more rigorous matching process than some other manufacturers offer on pairs costing $2500 or more. It means that your two Mini K47 will sound identical to one another. Matched pairs are packed into a single compact padded flight case, along with a pair of our acclaimed Cutaway shockmounts.Customers report great results using the Mini K47 matched pairs on stereo applications such as drum overheads, piano, acoustic guitar, and ensembles. see the Roswell Pro Audio site or Youtube for extensive demo videos.

Moreover, it\\'s still paired with a Neural Engine chip for advanced machine learning. The iPad Pro\\'s display features the same Liquid Retina technology found on iPhones, and has a 2732 x 2048 resolution, ProMotion technology, wide color and True Tone support, as well as a 600 cd/m2 brightness rating. On the rear, Apple has added a 10MP ultra-wide camera, enabling different perspectives and multi-camera use. A newly added LiDAR scanner, which determines distance by determining light reflection, further readies possibilities for augmented reality and beyond. With \"Pro\" in its name, the iPad now features five studio-quality microphones that capture clean audio and the quietest details. The combination of the pro cameras, audio enhancements, and its large display makes the iPad Pro a suitable mobile studio option for creative users. On the software side, iPadOS now supports trackpad inputs for an easier time navigating including mult-touch gestures. Lastly, Apple has opted for a USB Type-C connector rather than its traditional Lightning connector for additional features and broader compatibility with other devices.

Its winning combination of power, features, build quality, and affordability make it a must-have for all but the most demanding systems. With its advanced and extremely efficient low-heat design, the NewClassic Model 2125 v2 runs cooler than previous Parasound Classic series models, making it ideal for rack or cabinet mounting. The newly designed power supply delivers all the voltage you need for transient peaks in musical programs and stunningly realistic special effects. The Model 2125 v2 delivers the high-resolution power you need for big entertainment. It offers 150-watt-per-channel output at 8 ohms and 225 watts at 4 ohms. It will also deliver a huge 400 watts into 8 ohms or 4 ohms in bridged mono mode. And it boasts 35 amps of peak current per channel for superior resolution of demanding musical peaks. Fully discrete circuitry with a large toroidal transformer keeps the noise floor exceptionally low and the musical signal pure. The 'Class AB' circuitry provides efficient operation with less heat output than pure 'Class A' for the highest degree of reliability with DC servo and relay protection circuitry. Standby, channel status, and high temperature indicators keep you informed of the operation status. The NewClassic amplifiers have several features that make them ideal for custom installation. These include automatic switch on and off when the amplifier detects the presence or absence of an audio signal. It can also switch on and off via its DC trigger with looping output. The soft touch power buttons glow in standby mode. The Model 2125 v2 can drive and select two speaker pairs (or two mono bridged speakers) with two pairs of speaker terminals and speaker select buttons with relay switching.

First, it offers a usb output, allowing you to archive your vinyl tracks to your computer using easily available software you\u2019ll find on the web, including free audacity software. The second brand new feature is the ability to fine tune the pho 701 to a wide range of phono cartridges via dip switches on the bottom. With these switches, you can easily adjust the input capacitance and input impedance. The pho 701 puts its power supply in a completely separate chassis for pristine signal quality. It will reward you with an amazing vinyl experience. Separate cases for audio and power supply circuitry help isolate the signal chain from ac distortion and interference. The pho 701 performs its riaa correction with high precision for ultra low distortion and uses the highest quality audiophile parts, inside and out. It has a single phono input, which can be switched to accommodate low output mc cartridges or mm/high output mc cartridges. Vincent has deliberately omitted the typical 'wall art' ac power adapter, opting for a specially designed and highly developed outboard power supply instead. Feeling is believing. The power unit has impressive heft when held in the hand and testifies to the quality of the transformer, metal chassis, shielding, and other components. This no compromise approach to power helps the pho 701 to achieve its low noise performance. The pho 701 uses the same power supply that is already employed to great advantage in vincent's critically acclaimed pho 8 phono preamplifier. It is connected to the separate chassis audio circuitry using a nine pin din cable. The voltage is highly regulated and filtered, so that the ripple and hum found in unconditioned ac power right out of the wall will not reach the phono section. The delicate audio circuitry only receives clean power.\"] ['Two chassis mm/mc phono stage', 'Hybrid tube/solid state design', 'Highly regulated power supply in separate chassis', 'Inputs: 1x rca stereo, 1x din (dc in pho 700)'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"5.17 x 8 x 3.25 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"2.38 pounds\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"July 25, 2017\", \"Manufacturer\": \"VINCENT\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Sprint Booster is an application-specific hardware based product designed specifically for your car. This device is engineered to improve acceleration on drive by-wire cars by continuously measuring and converting the digital signal providing the ECM (Electronic Control Module) with a new and altered signal. Many modern vehicles utilize electronic throttle control and more vehicles are going that way, especially performance and sports cars. In conventional throttle systems, the accelerator pedal is connected to the throttle by a cable. In electronic throttle control systems, the accelerator pedal is connected to a sensor that sends a signal to the ECU that operates the throttle. The ECU increases or decreases throttle effort based on your accelerator pedal input, however this doesn't always translate to instant response. Things like pedal sensitivity, stability control and traction control systems can vary on different vehicles and can also lead to larger lag in throttle response and acceleration when its go-time. Sprint Booster improves response, increases pedal input sensitivity and delivers more impressive off the line performance. This product does not alter fuel or ignition in your vehicle; it's a simple plug-n-play mod that delivers instant response throughout the power band, making accelerating and revs matching incredibly more fun.\"] ['Response time is dramatically improved', 'Easier starts on hills', 'Performance in seconds', 'A more satisfying driving experience', 'Installs in minutes'] {\"Manufacturer\": \"SprintBooster\", \"Brand\": \"SprintBooster\", \"Item Weight\": \"3.2 ounces\", \"Package Dimensions\": \"3 x 3 x 1 inches\", \"Country of Origin\": \"United Kingdom\", \"Manufacturer Part Number\": \"\", \"Domestic Shipping\": \"Item can be shipped within U.S.\", \"International Shipping\": \"This item can be shipped to select countries outside of the U.S. Learn More\", \"Date First Available\": \"November 25, 2011\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Fits Strat Style Guitars with 6 Point Bridges*. (*Also fits 2 point bridge guitars with some drilling)The Rail Tail Tremolo is a full contact, dive-only tremolo designed to retrofit your existing Strat\u00ae-style 6-point tremolo with no modifications to your guitar; a clever design merging the feel and reliability of a hardtail bridge with the flexibility of a tremolo system. Computer designed and precision-machined, the Rail Tail achieves maximum performance and stunning appearance without compromising comfort or feel. Its unique features allow for adjustability to fit a variety of guitar bodies and for an easy DIY installation.Unlike the original tremolo design that rocks on a bevel located under the screw heads, the Rail Tail tremolo plate rotates around a precision rail that is mounted directly to the guitar body. The plate cradles the entire rail with precision as if they were one unit improving sound quality and tuning stability. This union also creates a greater breakpoint allowing open strings to maintain pitch when bending another, much like a hardtail.The tremolo plate consists of slotted string block mounting holes not only for accommodating installation but also allowing the string block to be positioned forward for greater rotational range. This means diving up to 15 degrees more than conventional tremolo bridges. An advanced string block also consists of game-changing features: Mid-positioned tapered string holes assist in true string saddle contact. Working in alliance with the rail and string block are the roller fitted string saddles. This entire assembly provides ultimate vibrational energy transfer from the strings to the guitar body resulting in better overall sustain and tonal qualities.Available in narrow (modern, 2-1/16\") and wide (vintage, (2-7/32\") models in Chrome, Black, Gold, Nickel and Black Nickel finishes. Please note: The Rail mounting holes are universal meaning that a narrow spaced Rail Tail will fit onto a wide spaced guitar body and vice versa.(For optimum performance, playing experience and reliability, it\u2019s highly recommend that the guitar this unit is being installed on, is equipped with locking tuners and a quality nut.)'] ['The Package Height of the product is 3 inches', 'The Package Length of the product is 7 inches', 'The Package Width of the product is 4 inches', 'Country of Origin: Korea, Republic Of (South)'] {\"Item Weight\": \"1.44 pounds\", \"Package Dimensions\": \"7.17 x 4.13 x 2.52 inches\", \"Country of Origin\": \"Korea, Republic of\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"March 20, 2017\", \"Color Name\": \"Gold\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Everything you need to start playing immediately comes in one box. Save yourself the hassle and save some money while you're at it. A stand is included so you don't need to purchase one separately. An instrument cable is included so you have an extra. An Austin Bazaar polishing cloth is included so you can keep your new instrument in mint condition. The Theremini is a re-imagination of one of the oldest electronic musical instruments in history, and Bob Moog's first love -- the Theremin. Its design fuses the experience of performing with an instrument you don't actually touch, with a powerful sound engine derived from Moog's award winning synthesizer, Animoog. The Theremini guarantees immediate success to any player at any skill level, while providing new ways to experiment with music, education, and gestural control.Assistive pitch quantization allows each player to adjust the instrument's level of playing difficulty. At the maximum position, the Theremini will play every note in a selected scale perfectly, making it impossible to play a wrong note. As this control is decreased, more expressive control of pitch and vibrato becomes possible. When set to minimum, the Theremini will perform as a traditional Theremin - the analog heterodyning oscillator controls pitch and there is absolutely no assistance.A built-in tuner supplies real-time visual feedback of each note as it is played, as well as its proximity to perfection. This is useful for correcting a user's playing position, and educating younger players about pitch and scales.The presets section allows you to select from 32 wave or wavetable-based patches, store a selected scale & root note, set and recall a specified playing range, and specify per-patch settings for the included stereo delay.Recessed in the top of the Theremini is a compact speaker perfect for privat\"] ['Pitch correction w/ selectable scales and root note', 'Built in tuner allows you to learn pitch and scales', '32 Wavetable based presets', 'Built in speaker', 'Headphone output'] {\"Item Weight\": \"12.27 pounds\", \"Date First Available\": \"February 28, 2014\", \"Color Name\": \"Theremini\", \"Number of Strings\": \"5\", \"Size\": \"Theremini Theremin\", \"Brand\": \"Moog Music Inc.\", \"Color\": \"Theremini\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"39 x 7 x 13 inches\", \"Finish Type\": \"Polished\", \"Instrument\": \"Synthesizer\", \"Operation Mode\": \"Manual\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}
