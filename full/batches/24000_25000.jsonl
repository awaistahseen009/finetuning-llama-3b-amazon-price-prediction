What's more, ThermoFloor's Field Impact Insulation Class (FIIC) rating of 60 exceeds the International Building Code standard of 50 for insulating floor noise in condominium and multi-story buildings. ThermoFloor's heating pad is treated and it wicks incidental spills and moisture to the perimeter of the floor where it can evaporate. ThermoFloor provides a separation membrane in tile and other cementitious floor installations to prevent grout line cracks. ThermoFloor replaces generic underlayments pads and installs without cement! ThermoFloor is ideal for new construction or when remodeling to make any room in the house cozier and more comfortable. Use ThermoFloor to heat or supplement any room, addition or basement. Installing a warm floor couldn't be easier. Select the ThermoFloor mat sizes that best fit your floor space.

Drive Impact Wrench Kit with Friction Ring Anvil (XWT17T) provides improved fastening control, ideal for automotive, installation, and fabrication trades. The impact wrench combines extended run time and speed control for unmatched fastening performance. The XWT17T is powered by a BL\u2122 Brushless Motor for longer run time. The brushless motor delivers 520 ft.lbs. of Fastening Torque and 740 ft.lbs. of Nut-Busting Torque. The electronically-controlled brushless motor efficiently uses energy to match torque and RPM to the changing demands of the application. Precise fastening control is achieved through the 4-speed power selection switch, which accounts for a wide range of applications. Additional precision features include three forward and three reverse rotation auto-stop modes, and a full-speed mode function that reduces the trigger pull to reach full speed. Makita\\'s proprietary hammer and anvil impact mechanism are manufactured using the best raw materials with the highest quality steel and unique heat hardening process for maximum fastening and driving power.

Designed for Canon full-frame-format DSLRs, this everyday lens is ideally suited for nearly any genre of photography, including travel, portraiture, landscape, and event shooting. Three aspherical elements pair with three super-low dispersion elements to produce bright, evenly-illuminated imagery with controlled aberrations and distortions, while multi-layer lens coatings help to reduce flare and ghosting for improved contrast and color accuracy. Well-suited to working in a wide variety of situations, this standard zoom covers an array of perspectives while maintaining consistent illumination for working in challenging lighting. Benefitting the usability, a one-touch focusing clutch permits quick switching between autofocus and manual focus modes, and an internal focusing design maintains the overall length of the lens during use. A Silent-Drive Module AF system suits both stills and video recording, too, by providing quick and quiet performance. Additionally, this lens sees the incorporation of a nine-blade diaphragm, which contributes to a pleasing out-of-focus quality when employing shallow depth of field shooting techniques. Compatible with Canon full-frame-format DSLRs, this standard zoom can also be used with APS-C-format DSLRs where it will provide a 38.4-112mm equivalent focal length range. Constant f/2.8 maximum aperture provides consistent performance throughout the zoom range and also contributes to greater control over focus position and when working in low-light conditions.\"] ['EF Mount Lens/Full-Frame Format.

The D300 features a new 51-point autofocus system with Nikon's 3D Focus Tracking feature and two new LiveView shooting modes that allow users to frame a photograph using the camera's high-resolution LCD monitor. The D300 shares a similar Scene Recognition System as is found in the D3; it promises to greatly enhance the accuracy of autofocus, autoexposure, and auto white balance by recognizing the subject or scene being photographed and applying this information to the calculations for the three functions.\", 'The D300 reacts with lightning speed, powering up in a mere 0.13 seconds and shooting with an imperceptible 45-millisecond shutter release lag time. The D300 is capable of shooting at a rapid six frames per second and can go as fast as eight frames per second when using the optional MB-D10 multi-power battery pack. In continuous bursts, the D300 can shoot up to 100 shots at full 12.3-megapixel resolution.

Its new Scene Recognition System advances the use of Nikon's acclaimed 1,005-segment sensor to recognize colors and light patterns that help the camera determine the subject and the type of scene being photographed before a picture is taken. This information is used to improve the accuracy of autofocus, autoexposure, and auto white balance functions in the D300. For example, the camera can track moving subjects better and by identifying them, it can also automatically select focus points faster and with greater accuracy. It can also analyze highlights and more accurately determine exposure, as well as infer light sources to deliver more accurate white balance detection.\", \"The D300 incorporates Nikon's new Multi-CAM 3500DX autofocus module that features an intelligent array of 15 cross-type sensors and 36 horizontal sensors. These sensors can either be used individually or in groups, with the option for Single area AF mode and Dynamic AF modes using groups of either nine, 21, or all 51 focus points. The system also features 3D tracking with automatic focus-point switching that takes advantage of all 51 AF points as it uses color and light information to accurately track the subject.

The AF 85mm F1.4 E II (Large-Aperture Standard) lens delivers a 28.9\u02da angle of view for full-frame & 19.1\u02da for APS-C, as well as a bright maximum aperture of F1.4, as preferred by full-frame camera users. In particular, optimum resolution is achieved through the optical design of 11 elements in 8 groups (4 HR and 1 ED). Combined with Sony's full-frame image sensor, this lens delivers superior sharpness and contrast in all areas of the image. Fast and Quiet AF Performance Tracking the subject accurately and quickly, the AF also operates quietly and smoothly when shooting video. Samyang\u2019s Linear STM (Stepping Motor) satisfies both photographers and videographers with quieter and more accurate control of the focusing lens groups. Impressive Background Blur and Bokeh with Bright F1.4 Aperture The AF 85mm F1.4 E II uses a large-diameter aperture to provide smooth background blur. It effectively separates the subject from the background, using a shallow depth of field and adding drama to the scene. The 9 diaphragm blades create smooth and natural bokeh with light splitting. Less Breathing for Shooting Video The AF 85mm F1.4 E II has minimized focus breathing, so there is almost no change in the angle of view when focusing and therefore less screen shake. This is effective when shooting movies with the subject moving forward or backward, or focusing from the front or back. Enhanced Usability with Custom Switch and Focus Hold Button There is a custom switch, which can be set allow adjustment of the aperture by rotating the focus ring. Using the optional Lens Station, you can setup the mode to suit your own preference*. * More functions will be added through firmware updates in the future Customizable Focus-Hold Button Pressing and holding this button will keep the lens locked at the auto-focused distance. The user can also assign to the focus hold button other desired functions through the Custom Key Settings menu of the camera. Short Minimum Focal Distance The minimum focal distance is just 0.85m (2.79ft), so it is versatile and possible to produce a unique perspective close to the subject. This makes it easier to take close-up and dramatic shots of food, portraits and nature. Weather-Sealing Design The usability of the AF 85mm F1.4 E II lens has been developed and enhanced, taking into consideration not only the design but also the user's shooting environment. It has a micro-patterned rubber focus ring, so feels great to operate and weather-sealing also protects the lens from light rain, snow and dust.\"] ['Features weather sealing at 4 spots on the lens to protect from light dust, rain, and snow and provide the ability to capture stunning images in less than perfect conditions.', 'Focus Hold Button - Pressing this button on the lens will keep the lens locked to that focusing distance.

A compact and lightweight telephoto zoom lens that's perfect for every journey. The compact, lightweight design weighs 819 grams (approx.), this zoom lens covers the 35mm image circle of full-frame DSLRs, and provides a focal length range of 70mm to 210mm which is ideal for handheld outdoor photography. When mounted on an APS-C camera, its focal length range is extended to the equivalent of 107mm to 322mm in the 35mm format. The optics consist of 20-elements in 14-group, which incorporate three ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass elements and two anomalous dispersion glass elements to deliver high-contrast, high-resolution images with edge-to-edge sharpness, while effectively compensating for distortion and chromatic and coma aberrations. In addition to a minimum focusing distance of 0.95 meters, the lens barrel was designed not to extent during operation to keep the overall dimensions intact. This allows the photographer to actively enjoy active outdoor photography in a wide range of shooting situations, including landscape photography, townscape shooting taking advantage of a beautiful bokeh (defocus) effect in the foreground and background, close-up photography of animals and plants, as well as sports and wildlife photography where its portable design really comes in handy.2. HD Coating to enhance the imaging power of your cameraThis lens features the latest HD Coating from PENTAX. Compared to conventional multi-layer coatings, this high-grade, multi-layer coating not only improves light transmission, but also reduces average reflectance in the visible light range by more than 50 percent, minimizing the adverse effects of flare and ghosting even in demanding lighting conditions where the subject is backlit.3. Weather-resistant construction, perfect for outdoor photographyThis zoom lens features a weather-resistant construction to prevent the intrusion of water into the lens barrel. When mounted on a PENTAX weather-resistant digital SLR camera body, it assures a durable, reliable digital imaging system that performs superbly in demanding shooting situations \u2014 even in rain or mist, or at locations prone to water splashes or spray.4. SP Coating to repel stainsThis lens features SP (Super Protect) Coating on its front surface. Applied by means of a PENTAX-exclusive fluorine deposition process, this coating is highly repellent to water, grease and dirt, making it easy to wipe off stains such as fingerprints. This frees the photographer from worries in outdoor photography.5. Built-in SDMThis lens incorporates a ring-type SDM (Supersonic Direct-drive Motor) to assure quiet, high-speed AF operation and improve operability in outdoor shooting.6. Other features\u30fbQuick-shift Focus System, to provide instant shift to manual-focus operation, after locking the subject in focus during AF operation by pressing the shutter-release button halfway down\u30fbTwo-step focus range limiter, to minimize AF operation time\u30fbNine-blade, round-shaped diaphragm, to produce a na ['IN-CAMERA SHAKE (SR): The PENTAX digital SLR K series cameras are equipped with the SR mechanism built into the camera body.

The secret to its outstanding performance lies in its Folded Motion tweeter, 5.5\" aluminum cone midrange driver, dual 6.5\" aluminum cone woofers with a rear-firing bass port, and a proprietary Vojtko crossover network. This double woofer design produces vibrant, accurate deep bass performance. The Motion 40i delivers the classic broad soundstage of the Motion Series from a newly designed enclosure enhanced by the slightest of modifications, including the drive-stabilizing dust cap design, stiffened motor suspension, and low-mounted woofers to reduce an acoustically harmful phenomenon known as floor bounce. The speaker\\'s enclosure sports a reinforced baffle and a fabric grille. The success of the Motion Series is directly attributed to its close relation to MartinLogan\\'s legendary ultra-high-end electrostatic loudspeakers. The desire to transmute that level of performance into a more traditional loudspeaker at a more affordable price drove the initial design imperatives that created the Motion Series. MartinLogan\\'s signature Folded Motion tweeter utilizes an extremely low mass diaphragm that \"squeezes\" air, thus demanding significantly less excursion than the typical 1-inch dome tweeter. Its folded design allows for a much larger surface area (compared to that of a regular 1\" dome tweeter), controlled dispersion characteristics, and vanishingly low distortion. It\\'s a miracle of audio engineering that\\'s able to deliver much of the high-frequency detail and speed of a large, dynamic electrostatic panel in a small space. Custom built, low-distortion drivers pair high-power magnet structures with aluminum cone diaphragms to deliver massive excursion and sound output, preserve minute bass details, and maximize power handling capability, all without a hint of distortion. A unique concave dust cap design reinforces the strength and rigidity of the cone while reducing break up modes. The use of aluminum for cones maximizes rigidity and strength of the drivers without adding excessive weight. This, along with the exceptional damping properties of aluminum, ensures the smooth, non-resonant response necessary for seamless blending with high-resolution Folded Motion tweeters. An added benefit of aluminum is its outstanding thermal conduction capability which allows cones to serve as efficient heat sinks for voice coils. Floorstanding Motion models utilize 2.5-way designs that feature woofers positioned low in the cabinet and close to the floor. This deliberate design addresses a phenomenon known as floor bounce where sound reflected off the floor (from drivers positioned high on a cabinet) and sound aimed directly at the listener interfere with each other. Without addressing these issues, listeners would experience bloated bass and massive increases and decreases in sound levels throughout critical midrange frequencies.'] ['High Frequency Transducer: 1\" \u00d7 1.4\" (2.6cm \u00d7 3.6cm) Folded Motion Transducer with 5.25\" \u00d7 1.75\" (13.3cm \u00d7 4.4cm) diaphragm', 'Mid Frequency Transducer: 5.5\" (14cm) aluminum cone in a non-resonant asymmetrical chamber format.

The detector has an alphanumeric LCD screen that can be adjusted by the user to show the gas type monitored, the two alarm set-points, the alarm type, the maximum gas level recorded within the previous 24-hour period, the time elapsed since reaching that maximum level, and the battery life remaining. It is operated and adjusted with a single push button. This detector is used to indicate potentially harmful levels of ozone gas naturally occurring in the environment; in a variety of occupational settings such as petroleum refineries, tanneries, sewage treatment facilities, and paper mills; and in other personal safety, educational, and ambient monitoring applications.', 'This detector is set to alert to when gas levels reach any of four limits: a low-alarm level, indicating moderate danger; a high-alarm level, indicating significant danger; a short-term exposure limit (STEL), the maximum gas concentration to which workers can be exposed continuously for a short period of time without serious risk, and a time-weighted average (TWA) limit, the maximum average exposure that personnel can experience over an eight-hour work shift without serious risk. Alarm set-points are user-adjustable. In low-alarm conditions and when the TWA is exceeded, the audible alarm beeps, the visual alarm flashes, and the unit vibrates slowly. In high-alarm conditions and when the STEL is exceeded, the audible alarm beeps, the visual alarm flashes, and the unit vibrates quickly. The three bright, wide-angle visual alarm bars and the built-in vibration alarm help alert the user to potentially dangerous levels of ozone in high-noise conditions. Once the gas exposure alarm initiates, the detector records the maximum gas exposure and the time since reaching that maximum gas exposure for up to 24 hours. The detector logs and retains data of the 10 most recent gas exposure events, which it can transmit via an infrared Datalink USB adapter to a personal computer (both sold separately).', 'To ensure performance, the detector tests its sensor integrity, circuitry, and audible and visual alarms upon activation. It tests its battery upon activation and continuously every 0.5 second. The detector also features an automatic shutdown mode for additional safety, which activates when the detector fails its self-test. This detector comes with a back-mounted alligator clip to allow the unit to be worn on a belt, waistband, or lapel, and a concussion-resistant boot to help protect it against damage.

First, as with many of the Porter-Cable combo kits, this one comes with two ni-cad rechargeable batteries and a diagnostic charger with an LED warning system. The batteries are interchangeable so they'll work with other Porter-Cable 19.2-volt tools. Each charges in less then an hour and provides plenty of run time for most uses. The batteries have a unique slide-on loading system in the base of each tool that makes battery attachment extremely tight and almost impervious to wear. The 19.2-volt hammer drill has a 1/2-inch keyless chuck that's easy to adjust and reacts quickly to the trigger. It offers 390 inch-pounds of maximum torque, a 20-position clutch, and a two-speed gearbox that does up to 1,500 rotations per minute and 19,500 beats per minute. This is plenty of power for any home-based project, and generally plenty of power for professionals. It's relatively lightweight and, in our opinion, as solid as any drill/driver we've used. The Saw Boss 19.2-volt cordless circular saw uses a 6-inch blade, turns up to 3,250 rpm, and makes up to 100 crosscuts on two-by-four material on a single charge. There's an easy-to-adjust guide plate for both bevel and depth of cut. The 19.2-volt Tiger Saw offers a Quik-Change blade clamp, a 1-inch stroke, and variable speed up to 2,900 strokes per minute. The grips are well designed and easy to hold. We were impressed with the solid feel and smooth cut of the Saw Boss and Tiger Saw, and quickly found ourselves reaching for these cordless tools more often than their corded counterparts.

It includes Rokinon's key features, such as: focus lock button, custom switch, and focus range limiter switch. With Rokinon's announcement of the new AF 135mm F1.8 E, its Auto Focus F1.8 E series now includes: 24mm, 35mm, 45mm, 75mm and 135mm focal lengths, completing the lineup from wide-angle to telephoto. AF 135mm F1.8 FE Key Features Superb Resolution Unsparing application of Rokinon's most advanced optical technologies has produced a large-aperture prime telephoto lens that delivers outstanding corner-to-corner resolution. The AF 135mm F1.8 FE delivers an 18.9\u02da angle of view for full-frame and 12.5\u02da for APS-C. It features a bright maximum aperture of F1.8 throughout the entire image, as favoured by full-frame camera users. In particular, optimum resolution is achieved through the optical design of 13 elements in 11 groups (1 U-ASP, 2 HR and 3 ED). Combined with Sony's full-frame image sensor, this lens delivers superior sharpness and contrast in all areas of the image. Able to deliver extremely narrow depth of field, with beautiful bokeh The AF 135mm F1.8 FE uses a large-diameter aperture to provide smooth background blur. It effectively allows separation of the subject from the background, by using a shallow depth of field. Also, it is equipped with a UA (Ultra-precision Aspherical) lens, which delivers natural and refined bokeh. Using this smooth bokeh, you can freely create images highlighting your subjects against stunning backgrounds, whether shooting portraits, close-ups or even cityscapes. Fast and Quiet Auto Focus Performance Tracking the subject accurately and quickly, the AF also operates quietly and smoothly when shooting video. Rokinon's Linear STM (Stepping Motor) satisfies both photographers and videographers with quieter and more accurate control of the focusing lens groups. Enhanced Operability and Reliability Important features include customisable: A Focus Hold button, Custom Switch and Focus Range Limiter. Overall, this is a lens that meets or exceeds professional requirement for control and reliability for both stills and movies. 1) Focus Hold Button Pressing this button on the lens will keep the lens locked to that focusing distance. You can assign functions such as Eye AF in settings on the camera body. 2) Custom Switch There is a custom switch, which can be set to allow adjustment of the aperture silently by rotating the focus ring. Using the optional Lens Station, you can set up the mode to suit your own preference*. (*More functions will be added through firmware updates in the future.) 3) Focus Range Limiter switch The Focus Range Limiter only operates in AF mode. \u2022 It is useful when the distance from an object has been determined. \u2022 Move the Focus Range Limiter forward or backward to select the focus range. - FULL: The AF range is set to infinity at a minimum focus distance of 0.69m.
