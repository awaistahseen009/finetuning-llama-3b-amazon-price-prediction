These spring-loaded and steel bodied fasteners are dedicated to light clamping forces (No more than 25lbs.) and are a simple, plier-actuated, inexpensive, alternative to competitive fasteners. The cleco fastener (sometimes spelled cleko), also known as a skin pin, is a fastener that was originally developed by the Cleveland Pneumatic Tool Company. Cleco fasteners are widely used in the manufacture and repair of aluminum-skinned aircraft and in automotive repair, where they are used to temporarily fasten multiple sheets of material together before the pieces are permanently joined. Cleco Pliers Cleco pliers are specially designed for installing spring-loaded temporary fasteners. A specially designed ''body seat'' holds the fastener in place while the plunger is depressed. These nickel-plated or black-oxide coated pliers are constructed of forged steel, thus resisting wear, abuse, and corrosion.

The groundbreaking aperture combined with the versatile wide-angle 24-35mm focal length allows photographers to easily replace three common lenses, the 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm, with one piece of gear. The lens also offers exceptional control over depth-of-field with an aperture range from f/2 to 16, and when used on APS-C camera bodies it has an equivalent focal length of 38.4-56. Along with the rest of the Art series, the 24-35mm offers high quality optics with the use of one \"F\" Low Dispersion and seven Special Low Dispersion glass elements in addition to two aspherical lenses. This system minimizes the appearance of spherical aberration, axial chromatic aberration and field curvature. A Super Multi-Layer Coating is present to reduce flare and ghosting for sharp, high-contrast images and it can focus as close as 11\". In terms of speed, this lens is equipped with a Hyper Sonic AF Motor which is nearly silent and has an optimized autofocus algorithm for fast, accurate tracking.

The various differences in materials and build process create unique personalities in both frequency and response. For example, some speakers will embellish the top-end treble for clarity, while others might subdue those higher frequencies for a warmer overall sound. Furthermore, different build materials change the way a speaker responds to your playing. Some speakers have a more aggressive response, making the amp more dynamic, while other speakers offer a naturally compressed, slower response, making the amp slightly less dynamic, but more forgiving and bluesy. With that in mind, VOX is proud to announce their latest limited edition line of AC15 amps, equipped with Warehouse Guitar Speakers\u2019 G12C model! Completely handmade in Kentucky, USA, the G12C is part of Warehouse\u2019s American Vintage series which lends a unique, American flavor to the iconic British chime of the AC15. These speakers provide a punchy low-end and distinctively clear top end that is still dynamic and sensitive.

When mounted on the adapter, The Leica 90mm macro-elmar-m f/4.0 can also be used in its collapsed position for exposures up to infinity. Thanks to a new locking function, this allows photographers to set any distance from 41 cm (reproduction ratio 1: 2) to infinity without having to dismount the adapter.As the Macro adapter is also compatible with other m lenses, It offers Leica M photographers An even wider range of opportunities for creative composition and additional variety in reportage portfolios. With Leica lenses from 50 mm and greater, It enables macro exposures up to a reproduction ratio of 1: 2 and, with wide-angle lenses, even larger ratios. The lens-to-subject distance decreases with decreasing focal lengths. The use of the adapter with 28, 35 or 50 mm lenses creates fascinating effects. The short distance from the subject creates extremely distorted perspectives and highly selective sharpness. Because, in contrast to a macro lens design, the imaging performance of these lenses is not optimized for such close focusing distances, It is advisable to stop them down by one or two aperture values. The use of the Macro adapter with lenses with focal lengths of less than 28 mm is not recommended, as the lens-to-subject distance must be extremely short to allow correct focusing.'] ['Front and rear Caps', 'Soft pouch', 'Limited 2-year warranty'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"4 x 4 x 4 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"10.4 ounces\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"June 27, 2014\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Leica\", \"Brand\": \"Leica\", \"Lens Type\": \"Standard\", \"Compatible Mountings\": \"Leica M\", \"Maximum Focal Length\": \"0.1\", \"Minimum Focal Length\": \"0.01\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

High-speed steel (HSS) provides hardness for wear resistance, and the black oxide finish acts as a lubricant to reduce wear while promoting chip and coolant flow. A jobber length drill bit has a versatile midrange drilling depth that is a common choice for general-purpose drilling applications. The round shank accommodates most drill chucks.The set comes in a gray epoxy-coated steel index case with labeled compartments for identification and organization. Case measures 13-5/8 x 5 x 2-5/8 inches (H x W x D). (H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back.)Drill bits are cutting tools used to make holes in a range of materials using machines such as handheld portable drills, machining centers, and lathes. Drill bits come in a variety of lengths and types, the most common of which is the twist drill bit. The round, twisted shaft of the twist drill bit typically has two cutting edges and flutes. The helical twist of the flutes brings chips up and away from the cutting edges and allows for coolant to reach the cutting edges. Jobber length twist drill bits, the most common length of twist drill bit, offer a good compromise of length and reach to work with the widest range of materials and applications. Mechanic's length twist drill bits (also called maintenance length) are a little shorter than jobber length and less prone to deflection when drilling. Short length twist drill bits (also called stub or screw-machine length) are the shortest and stiffest twist drill bits, helping to reduce the chance of deflection or breakage when drilling. Reduced shank drill bits (also called Silver and Deming drill bits) have a shank that is smaller in diameter than its shaft, permitting drilling machines with either a 1/2-Inches or 3/4-Inches drill chuck to create large holes. Long length twist drill bits (also called taper length) are a little longer than jobber length, allowing for deeper holes and longer reach. Extra long twist drill bits (also called extension) are longer than long length twist drill bits for greater reach or for drilling deeper holes.Chicago-Latrobe manufactures drill bits and accessories, reamers, countersinks, and blanks. The company, founded in 1890 and headquartered in Clemson, SC, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 9001.What\u2019s in the Box? 115 drill bits, inch sizes 1/16-Inches through 1/2-Inches in 1/64-Inches increments, one each of letter sizes A through Z, and one each of wire gauge sizes #6 ['Set of 115 jobber length drill bits includes inch sizes 1/16\" through 1/2\" in 1/64\" increments, one each of letter sizes A through Z, and one each of wire gauge sizes #60 through #1', 'High-speed steel (HSS) provides hardness for wear resistance', 'Black oxide finish reduces bit wear while promoting chip and coolant flow on ferrous material', '118-degree conventional point for a range of drilling applications', 'Jobber length drill bit has a midrange drilling depth suitable for general-purpose drilling applications', 'Made in the USA'] {\"Material\": \"High Speed Steel\", \"Finish Type\": \"Black Oxide\", \"Shank Type\": \"Straight\", \"Cutting Angle String\": \"118 Degrees\", \"Brand\": \"Chicago Latrobe\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"2.46 x 13.58 x 5 inches\", \"Point Style\": \"Conventional point\", \"Surface Recommendation\": \"Alloy Steel\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Gre"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

With Emit 20 thats exactly what youll get: a premium audiophile speaker that astonishes at the price. It might be an \"entry-level\" model but Emit 20 is still crammed with technology that youll find in their other families right up to the flagship Confidence range and the Core professional reference monitors. Make no mistake: youll experience performance you simply wouldnt expect at this level. Mid/bass power and control Emit 20 uses an 18cm MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) woofer based on the one used in the Evoke series. MSP is a material Dynaudio developed in-house and have used for many years on their most renowned models. The cone itself is a one-piece design; the dust-cap is molded as part of the playing surface which gives it a solid connection to the voice-coil that moves it back and forth. Youll hear that connection as supreme control and detail in the low and midrange frequencies. The voice-coil itself is aluminum wound onto a two-layer glass-fiber former. Dynaudio has a long history of using aluminum wire in their voice coils and for good reason. Its light so doesnt impede fine movement and they can get more windings on the former for a given length of wire. That means more BL or magnetic power. More power means more punch. They have boosted that further too by coating the aluminum wire in copper.

ARIES 4\" oval side bars are made with strong 4\" elliptical tubing and are available in two finish options: polished stainless steel and black powder coat carbon steel. This set of side bars is constructed from 304 stainless steel, meaning high nickel content to be truly stainless. They easily resist rust and corrosion and feature a highly polished finish that is made to last. Something that sets the ARIES 4\" oval side bar apart is its blended end caps and OE-style bends. Rather than capping our side bars with a plastic cap, we offer a blended end cap for a smooth, finished appearance. We also equip the ends with a special 20-degree bend and original equipment styling to perfectly contour to your vehicle. ARIES 4\" oval side bars are fitted with raised step pads to provide a wide stepping surface. The polypropylene construction will not crack over time, and because it has a textured grip, the surface is highly resistant to slips and skids, even when wet. To add an extra element of class to our oval sides, we also fit each one with a stainless steel insignia bearing the ARIES name. Installation of ARIES 4\" oval side bars is quick and easy with custom-fitted mounting brackets and no drilling necessary.

Create images with a bright central area of sharp focus and striking color rendition surrounded by subtle, swirling bokeh and vignette. Use Burnside 35 to create stunning street and environmental portrait photos. The swirly bokeh and vignette give you added control to direct the viewer\u2019s eye to the most important part of the photo. For landscape photographers, Burnside 35 gives you the ability to try something new and experiment with swirling bokeh, subtle edge softness, and vignette \u2013 while being versatile enough to let you capture more traditional landscape imagery as well. Burnside 35 features two sets of internal aperture systems \u2013 one for aperture setting and a second for effect and vignetting. Burnside 35 allows you to control depth of field and the size of your central focus area while independently adding or subtracting vignette and swirl in your image using the gold slider. Create perfect harmony between focus, bokeh, and vignette by fine-tuning your composition using the gold effect slider. Slide the gold button up or down to control how much vignette creeps in, darkening the edges and really making the center pop with brightness. In addition, the gold slider adjusts the clarity of the swirl in images where that\u2019s a factor.

The lute-guitar is an attractive instrument of a similar size to the guitar but with a body like a lute. With a neck shaped like that of a guitar and a 51mm nut of ebony, it will appeal to those who are familiar with normal classical or acoustic guitars. It is tuned like a guitar with six strings, three of plain nylon and three of nylon wound in nickel. If it is to be used for lute music, the 3rd string may be tuned a semi-tone down to F# to enable the application of lute fingering. The lute has a long history dating back to pre-biblical times and although it has existed in many forms it may be classified as either short- or long-necked. The European lute and its ancestor, the oud, (or, \\'al\\'ud\\' meaning \\'the wood\\') are examples of the short-necked variety and were later developments. Examples of the lute-guitar, or some may call it guitar-lute, were plentiful in Germany towards the end of the 19th century and whilst it may be thought of as a type of guitar due to its stringing, six-course versions of the lute were also known in the Renaissance period. The term \\'course\\' refers to the arrangement of the stringing. A \\'course\\' may contain single, double or even triple strings, thus the guitar has single-string courses whereas the lute would be double strung.

The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-90x. The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port (camera sold separately). The WH10x20mm super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces combine with the 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective to provide continuous zoom magnification and a longer working distance for inspecting large-scale specimens that require handling or repair. The microscope comes with 0.5x and 2.0x Barlow lenses that can be added to the objective to increase the magnification range.

It has the same synth-engine as UltraNova, and comes with 256 sounds. It also has a fully editable Nova-class synth engine. MiniNova' s compact size, massive sound, and performance/editing controls make it perfect for producers, gigging musicians, and anyone creating music with computers. It can also be a 37 key controller keyboard with MIDI I/O. The VocalTune and vocoder enable you to recreate classic vocal effects, as well as new voice-bending possibilities. MiniNova has 256 onboard sounds and space to save another 128 sounds. It comes with a free software Patch Librarian so you can store as many sounds as you want on your computer. MiniNova has knobs that allow you to tweak and edit sounds, but it can also 'animate' sound with 8 back-lit buttons. These trigger 'mods' in the synth engine can warp sound in incredible ways. There is also a large knob for filter cutoff so you can get instant control. You can run your voice through MiniNova' s effects engine and there is an input into which you can plug a guitar or any other instrument and give it the same treatment. MiniNova has an enormously powerful synth engine with 14 conventional waveforms to choose from, 36 wavetables, and 20 digital waveforms. Each of the 3 oscillators (per voice) have density. There are 14 filter types, 6 envelope generators, 3 LFOs and 20 modulation slots where you can link modules of the synth engine together to shape sound. MiniNova can add up to 5 effects to each voice including distortion, reverb, chorus/phase, delay, compressor, EQ and Novation's unique gator effect. Editing sounds in such a powerful synth can be overwhelming, so we've created the MiniNova Editor which works as a plug-in within your DAW or music software. You can fully edit MiniNova using the hardware and the software makes it easier to see what you are doing.\", 'From the Manufacturer', 'Compact, super-cool studio and live synth with 256 onboard sounds.', 'View larger', \"MiniNova is a compact, super-cool studio and live synth with the same sound engine as its big brother, UltraNova. It comes with 256 incredible onboard sounds that you can tweak with five knobs, or totally warp with eight 'animate' buttons. It has up to 18 voices with as many as five synth effects on each sound. MiniNova also has an onboard VocalTune effect as well as a classic vocoder so you can recreate iconic vocal sounds from hip hop, urban and electronic music.\", \"But don't let its size fool you. MiniNova is the latest in the 'nova' range of synths dating back to the legendary Supernova series. It has the same incredibly powerful sound engine and synth effects as the Novation UltraNova, which means it is capable of creating and editing massive bass synth sounds, soaring leads, lush pads and vintage synth sounds.

Most visibly, \u201cspeed\u201d is about transferring large files as quickly as possible, or carrying enough data for an HD video. For USB audio (and for HDMI audio), \u201cspeed\u201d is critical not because of how-much how-fast, but because time relationships within a digital stream are critical to the reconstruction of the analog wave form that brings information, music and joy to our ears. Time-based damage (jitter) to this information within the data package makes the sound small and flat instead of 3D, harsh and foggy instead of smooth and clear. SuperSpeed USB 3.0 specifies data-transfer rates up to 4.8Gbps vs. Hi-Speed USB 2.0\u2019s maximum signaling rate of 480Mbps. SOLID - SILVER (PSS) Perfect-Surface Technology applied to extreme-purity silver provides unprecedented clarity and dynamic contrast. Perfect-Surface Silver (PSS) is AudioQuest\\'s highest-quality metal. Solid conductors prevent strand interaction, a major source of cable distortion.
