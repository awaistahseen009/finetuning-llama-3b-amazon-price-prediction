It\\'s a powerful floorstanding loudspeaker featuring a Folded Motion XT tweeter, a 6.5\" aluminum cone midrange driver, dual 8\" aluminum cone woofers with rear-firing bass ports, and a proprietary Vojtko crossover network. XT stands for extreme: lifelike details from the lightning-fast Folded Motion XT tweeter, open and authentic midrange performance, coupled with deep, musical bass response. These classic MartinLogan performance technologies have been enhanced for the Motion 60XTi by the slightest of modifications, including the drive-stabilizing dust cap design, stiffened motor suspension, and low-mounted woofers to reduce an acoustically harmful phenomenon known as floor bounce. The speaker\\'s enclosure sports increased internal bracing, a reinforced baffle, and a fabric grille. The success of the Motion Series is directly attributed to its close relation to MartinLogan\\'s legendary ultra-high-end electrostatic loudspeakers. The desire to transmute that level of performance into a more traditional loudspeaker at a more affordable price drove the initial design imperatives that created the Motion Series. MartinLogan\\'s signature Folded Motion tweeter utilizes an extremely low mass diaphragm that \"squeezes\" air, thus demanding significantly less excursion than the typical 1-inch dome tweeter. Its folded design allows for a much larger surface area (compared to that of a regular 1\" dome tweeter), controlled dispersion characteristics, and vanishingly low distortion. It\\'s a miracle of audio engineering that\\'s able to deliver much of the high-frequency detail and speed of a large, dynamic electrostatic panel in a small space. Folded Motion XT tweeters advance thin-film transducer technology even further, with a 40% larger radiating surface and 80x30-degree controlled dispersion. This tweak increases audible bandwidth without sacrificing details and minimizes distortion to an unprecedented level while increasing efficiency and the tweeter\\'s already lightning-fast response time. The superior realism and alarming specificity is aurally astounding. Custom built, low-distortion drivers pair high-power magnet structures with aluminum cone diaphragms to deliver massive excursion and sound output, preserve minute bass details, and maximize power handling capability, all without a hint of distortion. A unique concave dust cap design reinforces the strength and rigidity of the cone while reducing break up modes. Floorstanding Motion models utilize 2.5-way designs that feature woofers positioned low in the cabinet and close to the floor. This deliberate design addresses a phenomenon known as floor bounce where sound reflected off the floor (from drivers positioned high on a cabinet) and sound aimed directly at the listener interfere with each other. Without addressing these issues, listeners would experience bloated bass and massive increases and decreases in sound levels throughout critica ['High Frequency Transducer: 1.25\" \u00d7 2.4\" (3.2cm \u00d7 6.1cm) Folded Motion XT Transducer with 4.5\" x 2.75\" (11.4cm \u00d7 7cm) diaphragm', 'Mid Frequency Transducer: 6.5\u201d (16.5cm) aluminum cone with cast polymer basket.

Air enters the system through an oversized AEM Dryflow synthetic washable air filter for outstanding air flow, filtration and performance. The air filter is located in the original air box space and is protected by a heat shield which is designed to reduce intake air temperature and increase horsepower.

This air intake system was developed to accommodate the engine's factory emissions control devices including the intake air temperature sensor. The dual intake AEM Dryflow air filter is made from an oil-free, synthetic filter media that can be used for up to 100,000 miles before cleaning is needed (depending on driving conditions). The air intake system is easy to install with commonly available tools and it is backed by AEM's Lifetime Limited Warranty.

Rather than base our WA-87 circuit on current incarnations of this mic, we decided to closely follow the early circuit designs that date back nearly half a century. As is true with many classic microphones, engineers who have worked with different versions of these microphones often prefer the warmer, more forgiving nature of the earlier commercially available models. The desire to re-introduce the warm tone of this classic mic at an affordable price to an all new generation of recording artists was the inspiration behind the WA-87.

Whether recording, practicing, writing, or playing a small room, this amp has everything you need. The MT 15\u2019s design started with heavier players in mind, but in the end, it has a lot to offer players of all genres. Like the PRS Archon amplifier, the MT 15 features five gain stages before the Master for full, lush distortion. The gain channel gets big, chunky tone with massive, tight low end, but it never loses its articulate note definition or great lead tone. The clean channel is bright and chimney, good with chords and fingerstyle playing \u2013 whether with a pic or not. The clean channel also features a push/pull boost control that adds a little overdrive for old school crunch. No matter what tone you dial in, the MT 15 stays balanced across the spectrum with a sweet, smooth tone that won\u2019t bite your head off. Additional features include an effects loop and bias adjusters that are accessible from the back panel for ease of servicing. Despite its 15 watts, the MT 15 sounds more like 50, so a half power switch that takes the MT to 7 watts is a welcome addition.

The user can feel it in the exquisitely smooth texture of the metallic barrel. XY-Shift compensation has been newly added to reinforce VC functionality, further improving image stabilization. A high standard of Moisture-Proof and Dust-Resistant Construction has been added to prevent intrusion of dust or water droplets. Highly durable, Fluorine Coating is applied to the top element surface and efficiently prevents condensation of moisture and repels smudge-causing substances. The lens features an optical construction of 14 elements in 11 groups, including one LD (Low Dispersion) and two XLD (extra Low Dispersion) glass elements that in consonance help to control lateral and on-axis chromatic aberrations at a very high level of performance. A Floating System works in tandem with the optical construction to efficiently compensate for inherent aberration changes subject to varying distances. Therefore, this lens ensures seamless and outstanding depictive capabilities across the entire shooting range - close or far.

These amplifiers are part of the audio system, and is a GM-recommended replacement for your vehicle's original component. The purpose of the amplifier is to increase the power of a voltage or current signal. The output signal of an audio amplifier may consist of the same frequencies as the input signal or it may consist of only a portion of the frequencies, as in the case of a subwoofer or midrange speaker. The audio amplifier amplifies the signal and sends it to the appropriate speakers. Each of the audio output channel circuits (+ and ?) at the audio amplifier have a DC bias voltage that is approximately one half of the battery voltage. The audio being played on the system is produced by a varying AC voltage that is centered around the DC bias voltage on the same circuit. The AC voltage is what causes the speaker cone to move and produce sound. Both the DC bias voltage and the AC voltage signals are needed for the audio system to properly produce sound.

The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-90x. The 10MP camera has a CMOS color sensor, a reduction lens, image capture and editing software, and USB 2.0 output to capture or display still or video images on a computer or projector. The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port. The WH10x20mm super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces combine with the 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective to provide zoom magnification and a longer working distance for inspecting large-scale specimens that require handling or repair. The microscope comes with 0.5x and 2.0x Barlow lenses that can be added to the objective to increase the magnification range. A Barlow lens with a magnification of less than 1.0 reduces magnification and increases the working distance, while a Barlow lens with a magnification greater than 1.0 increases the magnification and reduces the working distance. High-eyepoint eyepieces ease viewing for users who wear glasses, and dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. A digital stereo microscope, sometimes called an inspection or dissection microscope, has low magnification and a long working distance that enables users to manipulate the object being inspected, and is used where image capture, detailed records, or documentation is required.', 'The 10MP digital camera has a CMOS color sensor for displaying still microscopy images and streaming live videos to a computer or projector. The camera has 40x magnification and a 0.5x reduction lens that ensures that the display has a similar field of view as the microscope eyepiece. The camera can be mounted in a C-Mount or any 23mm eye tube. The camera includes image capture and editing software that provides still image and live video capture and editing capability, including measurement functions. The software supports JPG, TIF, GIF, PSD, WMF, and BMP file formats and is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8; Mac OS X; and Linux. Camera drivers are compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8; Mac OS X; and Linux. The software includes Windows APIs for native C/C++, C#, DirectShow, Twain, and LabVIEW that enable custom application development. The camera has a USB 2.0 data port (cable included).', 'The removable 144-bulb LED ring light provides bright, cool light for working with temperature-sensitive or live specimens.

If you still wonder the setup, we got pictures here to elaborate. The first picture basically gives you an idea of how it looks like when the hair light is used. The light projected from hair light will give your model a shinny and healthy hair look; however, the hair light should never draw people's attention from the subject area. In this photo, the mannequin seems to be a bit over exposed due to its white surface, but the overexposure may not be fully shown if the subject were really the human scalp. The second picture shows how the boom stand should be positioned in relative to the position of the model. Normally, the hair light should be placed above and behind the subject in order to create the shinny hair. The hair light is never designed to be used as a back light since the light is being directed to shine the hair rather than taking out shadow. The best way to take out the shadow is to use a halogen back light kit. However, people who are running on a tight budget may try to place a model a few more feet away from the wall to prevent the shadow registering on the image.\"] ['1800w Digital/Video 3 Twin Halogen Light Kit displayed here are the two of 650W halogen lights', 'The set body is lit up evenly with two 650W halogen lights and the reflection from the mirror', 'Bulb for 8054 Halogen Light 300/600 watt power adjustable light is similar to the HL8061 in their size comparison', 'The product may have turn her upper body 45 degrees left from the camera, and tilt her head about 20 degrees right from the camera', 'With with three 300w/600w Halogen Light (Power Adjustable)+6 bulb for 8054-1 Halogen Light+2 Compact Light Stand+1 Boom stand, 2 Softbox+1 D130mm Barndoor+2 carryin'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"24 x 24 x 96 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"20 pounds\", \"Date First Available\": \"October 9, 2010\", \"Manufacturer\": \"\", \"Brand\": \"BRITEK\", \"Has Self-Timer\": \"No\", \"Water Resistance Level\": \"Not Water Resistant\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The small and lightweight X70 offers intuitive operation with at-a-glance checking of important exposure settings.

Apertures can be changed in 1/3 or 1 stop increments for precise control, while the dials are milled from aluminum for ease of use and a comfortable feel.

This delivers instant high-quality results with settings chased based on 54 pre-programmed scenes.
