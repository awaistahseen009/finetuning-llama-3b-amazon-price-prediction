The reliability of your primary sump pump is important but it is absolutely critical for the backup sump pump, which is your \"last line of defense\" against basement flooding. This simple and elegant design requires no batteries or electricity. During a heavy rainstorm or snow melt, you do not have to worry about a power outage or sump pump failure, or about the battery on a battery-powered back-up sump pump. When called upon, the water-powered backup pump can run infinitely, as long as municipal water is available \u2013 not limited by a battery charge. This pump requires no cleaning or maintenance. There is no impeller or motor \u2013 no rotating parts to break or wear off. It is constructed of heavy duty, corrosion-resistant materials for practically unlimited longevity. How does it work? Works on a well-proven and reliable principle - Pressurized municipal water pushes through the pump (Venturi nozzle) and as it speeds up, its pressure drops. This creates suction. The sump pump (\"ejector\") draws water from the sump pit by suction just like through a giant soda straw. The operation is fully automatic \u2013 it works whether you are home or away. The backup pump has its own float switch, which activates the pump when water level in the sump pit rises too high \u2013 above the level normally allowed by the primary sump pump. This simultaneously activates an audible high water alarm to let you know that there is something wrong with the primary pump or the power supply. City water pressure: Required 40 to 100 psi at the pump. Type of piping: Install using copper or plastic piping approved in your area. Connecting pipe sizes: HB-1000 ... \u00be\". Flow restrictions: The pump must be \u201cteed in\u201d before any devices that reduce flow, such as a water softener, filter, or pressure regulator valves (PRV).'] ['No electricity or batteries needed!', 'Can run infinitely, as long as municipal water is available', 'No cleaning or maintenance.

The Banshee 2 gives you the ability to let the guitar signal feed your amplifier at the same time that the talkbox effect is turned on!! This way you get your normal guitar signal through your amp while the talkbox effect runs through a mic (and your sound system). Rocktron has brought an exciting new dimension to the talkbox with the Banshee 2 by providing an effects loop which now lets you add other effects into the talkbox signal path, or through your guitar signal path at the same time! These new features allow you to get some wild new sounds never before done with a talkbox! We\u2019ve also added an active LED to tell you when the Banshee 2 effect is engaged. The original Banshee has served countless players over the years with a modern version of the talkbox. You\u2019ve heard a talkbox used on many famous recordings, from classic rock (Aerosmith, Joe Walsh, Peter Frampton) to contemporary rock (Bon Jovi, Disturbed) to hip hop recordings and more. The Banshee models provide easy setup (unlike vintage style talkboxes which are cumbersome to hook up and can potentially damage your gear by blowing up your amp head). What makes the Banshees so unique is the included internal preamp, amplifier, and horn driver. Simply plug into the Banshee as you would any common stomp box, and run the provided \u201ctubing\u201d up the mic stand and into your mouth. The rest is up to your imagination as you get the most incredible sounds from your instrument (guitar or keyboard). The Banshee's preamp section features controls for gain, tone, and output level.

Although the motors are noisy when slewing from object to object, the selected target is usually within the field of the 25-mm eyepiece. Once in a while, however, the telescope will go into a \"death slew,\" seemingly spinning around aimlessly. To bring the scope back to its senses, press one of the direction keys, then \"Enter\" to try again. Sometimes, this will happen when the batteries are running out of power, for which the NexStar 4GT has quite an appetite.

['Tele Vue is known for its in-house eyepiece and telescope designs by Al Nagler; our latest eyepiece brings new meaning to the term \"in-house.\" The concept for this eyepiece was first proposed by Tele Vue President David Nagler, with performance parameters giving it the fundamental characteristics (the ethos) of a Tele Vue eyepiece: high contrast, comfortable eye relief and full field sharpness. Control of astigmatism, field curvature, lateral color, angular magnification distortion correction (technical reference), and low pupil sensitivity for daytime use were specified criteria. Following Tele Vue\\'s philosophy of pushing the state of the art, long-time Tele Vue employee and optical design protege Paul Dellechiaie took up the challenge and designed the basic eyepiece form. Under Al\\'s guidance, Paul tweaked his design to fulfill the original goals. While sharpness is inherent to the optical design, contrast is maximized through the intelligent use of flat finished baffles and ultra low reflectance, high efficiency coatings tuned to the composition of each element.

All these things ultimately save you money! Coring is a very time effective method to make a bowl. You are not only done faster, but it is also less physically demanding and gives you the ability to get several bowls out of one piece. Hollowing out a large bowl can take a large toll on your tools. Coring does require the cutter to be sharpened regularly, but the amount of sharpening required per bowl is drastically reduced.Features: Oneway Model #3202, 16 1/4\u201d Easy Core Bowl Coring Knife Set, with Steel Cutter16 1/4\u201d Easycore Knife Set Only.

Engineered for maximum linear displacement with extensive inductance control, this massive subwoofer produces unmatched low frequency extension and high output with the lowest possible distortion. Optimized for small enclosures and with dual 2-ohm voice coils, the -22 is flexible enough to add breath taking bass to high output home and car audio designs. Remarkably powerful low distortion motor In order to keep precise control of the cone when driven to high excursion, the -22 requires an incredibly powerful motor. A stack of 3 high energy Y-35 ferrite magnets is used to provide the force needed while allowing ample clearance for the voice coil to travel without impacting the back plate. A copper ring and thick aluminum sleeve helps minimize stored energy and lower inductance as the coil travels through the motor. This massive motor assembly gives the -22 the ability to produce extremely low distortion and accurate response even when driven to the limits of its 54 mm peak-to-peak excursion. Amazing power handling with low power compression Driving the cone is a large 3\u201d diameter voice coil wound on a thick aluminum former that is capable of dissipating enough heat to handle up to 800 watts RMS. A spiral spit in the former minimizes the eddy currents that are induced into any conductive former, to further lower inductance and distortion.

The trinocular head has a vertical camera mount and a Siedentopf binocular mount with interchangeable pairs of WH10x and WH25x eyepieces, 55 to 75mm Siedentopf interpupillary adjustment, a fixed 30-degree vertical inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and a 360-degree rotation capability to provide a more comprehensive view and enable sharing. Dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. The vertical trinocular port accepts a camera with a 23mm or C-Mount adapter (camera sold separately). The mechanical tube length is 6-5/16\" (160mm). The reverse-mounted revolving nosepiece has 4x, 10x, 40xS, and 100xS (oil) DIN infinity plan achromatic objectives that provide color correction, focus over the entire range of the viewing field, and a longer working distance for improved focus when auxiliary components are utilized. The 40xS objective is spring loaded to prevent slide damage when focusing. The 100xS spring-loaded oil-immersion objective uses oil between the specimen and the objective lens to provide increased resolution over a standard objective. A compound microscope is used for inspection and dissection of specimens when two-dimensional images are desired.', 'The microscope has Brightfield (BF) illumination which allows the specimen to absorb light, resulting in a dark image on a light background. Halogen light source provides bright light in a concentrated path, and a Kohler condenser focuses and centers the light path using two iris diaphragms, providing optimum contrast and resolution. The graduated double-layer mechanical stage, with 1mm stage divisions, locks the slide into place and provides precise slide manipulation along the X- and Y-axis to allow coordinates to be recorded, enabling the viewer to return to a specific location on the slide. A stage stop prevents the stage or specimen from coming into contact with the objectives. The stage is 7.1 x 5.9 inches (180 x 150mm) and a traveling range of 3 x 2 inches (75 x 50mm).

If you're familiar with Drew's rig, he has always run super small, low-wattage amps, and run them wide-open to get his signature overdriven sound. The BELLE STARR was designed to recreate these tones. Not a high-gain overdrive, the BELLE STARR is a low/mid gain overdrive circuit that has the smooth and natural breakup that is characteristic in smaller, non-negative feedback amps. To make the overdrive as natural-sounding and amp-like as possible, we incorporated a unique clipping circuit (the part of the circuit that distorts the signal) and features MOSFET transistors instead of traditional silicon diodes. When used in a clipping circuit, the MOSFET transistors produce a very smooth and amp-like overdrive. The overdrive range on the BELLE STARR is so evenly spread out across the range of the GAIN control that it goes from absolutely clean to medium gain with no unusual jumps in the dynamic response. Over the 8 months that we spent dialing in the BELLE STARR, we have tried it with every variation of amp we could get our hands on. Fender, Marshall, Vox and of course our own Jackson amps. This was done to ensure that the BELLE STARR would work on any amp that you marry it to. We are very proud of the work that we have done with Drew and believe that the BELLE STARR is a dynamic, expressive and natural sounding overdrive that will fit perfectly into any rig!\"] ['Volume Control - Sets the overall level for the BELLE STARR', 'Body Control - An extremely powerful active EQ, the BODY control adjusts the low frequencies by giving a +/-15dB boost/cut to those frequencies', 'Gain Control - Controls the gain of your tone and how overdriven the BELLE STARR is', 'Tone Control - A beautifully voiced passive tone control; adjusts the treble frequencies much like the CUT control on a Vox amp', 'Can safely run from 9V-18V DC (center negative); Mechanical true bypass switch'] {\"Item Weight\": \"1 Pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"7 x 5 x 4 inches\", \"Date First Available\": \"September 9, 2019\", \"Signal Format\": \"Analog\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Voltage\": \"18 Volts\", \"Brand\": \"Jackson Audio\", \"Style\": \"Overdrive\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"7 x 5 x 4 inches\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The trinocular viewing head has a 23mm vertical camera mount, a sliding binocular head to adjust interpupillary distance, a fixed 30-degree vertical inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and a 360-degree rotation capability to enable sharing. The sliding head has a range of 55 to 75mm to accommodate individual eye differences, and bilateral dioptric adjustment to accommodate individual eye-strength differences. The forward-facing nosepiece has 4x, 10x, 40xS (spring), and 100xS (oil) DIN plan optical-glass objectives that combine with the eyepieces to provide color correction of magnified images. The 40xS objective is spring loaded to prevent slide damage when focusing. The 100xS spring-loaded oil-immersion objective uses oil between the specimen and the objective lens to provide increased resolution over a standard objective. Plan objectives provide improved focus over the entire range of the viewing field. A metallurgical microscope uses transmitted and reflected light to view opaque or metallic specimens, or larger specimens that cannot be viewed on a standard microscope stage.', 'The microscope has reflected episcopic (upper) illumination that reflects light off the specimen for enhanced visibility of opaque specimens, and lower (diascopic) illumination that transmits light up through the specimen for enhanced visibility of translucent and transparent objects. The episcopic illumination system has independent filter holders for yellow, blue, green, and frosted filters (included), an iris diaphragm with separate aperture and alignment controls to provide precision lighting control, and a 30W halogen light source that provides bright light in a concentrated path and has a rheostat to control light intensity. The diascopic illumination system has a rheostat-controlled 20W halogen light source to control the amount of light emanating from the lamp. Halogen illumination provides bright light in a concentrated path. The double-layer mechanical stage, with 1mm stage divisions and 0.1mm vernier graduations, locks the slide into place and provides precise slide manipulation along the X- and Y-axis to allow coordinates to be recorded, enabling the viewer to return to a specific location on the slide. A stage stop prevents the stage from coming into contact with the slide and objectives. The stage is 5-1/8 x 4-13/16 inches (130 x 122mm) and has a traveling range of 1-3/16 x 2-3/4 inches (30 x 70mm). Graduated coaxial coarse and fine focus has a focusing range of 1-9/16\" (40mm).

Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of May 2021. 2 Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson\u2019s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. 3. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of a replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of May 2021. 4 Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 200 pages. 5.

The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-225x. The binocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The WH10x20mm and WH25x9mm super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces combine with the 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective to provide 7x-112.5x zoom magnification and a longer working distance for inspecting large-scale specimens that require handling or repair. The microscope includes 0.5x and 2.0x Barlow lenses that can be added to the objective to increase the magnification range. A Barlow lens with a magnification of less than 1.0 reduces magnification and increases the working distance, while a Barlow lens with a magnification greater than 1.0 increases the magnification and reduces the working distance.

When General Motors first released the newly designed 2014 Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra 1500 4WD trucks we purchased one of the very first truck trucks off the line so that we could test fit and engineer the proper 4\" SST Lift Kit. The 2014 4WD suspension has many completely new design features. Some of these changes include evolution to an electric steering rack, completely different differential mounting system and an aluminum control arm design and different spindle than its predecessor. The new ReadyLIFT 69-3416 4\" SST Lift Kit combines many of the great features of our time-tested and very popular 4\" SST Lift Kit for the 2007-2013 trucks with new innovative features. Some of the new features implemented into this system include a completely different differential drop mounting system which now utilizes machined billet circular spacers which allows for just the right amount of differential drop without interfering with the new rear mounted electric steering rack. Additionally, a newly designed skid plate accompanies our differential drop system. Factory changes to the spindle/upright allows us to now include the heavy duty ball joints we developed for the GM 2500 HD trucks but designed exclusively for the STEEL suspension on 2014 GM 1500 trucks. These ball joints are vastly superior and are already installed into the tubular steel upper control arms provided in the 69-3416 kit. This kit also includes newly designed UCA inner bushings and new washer backing spacer sleeves which greatly prolong the life of the bushings. The 69-3416 kit is for use on trucks with the factory steel upper and lower control arms. Not for use on trucks with aluminum upper control arms or Z-71 Off Road trucks. Standard Z71 okay.

We designed the new MacBook to be not only thinner and lighter, but more functional and intuitive than ever before. To do that, we couldn't just shave a millimeter here, a gram there. So we started from scratch, reinventing each essential element as part of a singular, deceptively simple design. It's everything there is to love about Mac. In its purest form ever. A keyboard reimagined from A to Z. From the beginning, our goal was to design a full, uncompromising Mac experience. And a full-size keyboard is an essential part of that. In order to fit a full-size keyboard in the incredibly thin MacBook, we designed the keyboard from the ground up. Each component has been rethought specifically for the new MacBook, from the underlying mechanism to the curvature of the surface of each key to the distinctive new typeface. The result is a keyboard dramatically thinner than its predecessor. Now when your finger strikes the key, it goes down and bounces back with a crisp, consistent motion that makes typing with precision a breeze. Butterfly mechanism. Traditional keyboards use a scissor mechanism, which tends to wobble around the edges. This creates a lack of precision when you strike anywhere except the center of the key. We needed to reduce key wobbling for a keyboard this thin; otherwise, striking a key off-center could result in the keycap hitting bottom before a keystroke registers.
