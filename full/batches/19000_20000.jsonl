Built on the foundation of the popular 4x4s, the PRO USB SERIES are durably constructed, reliable power conditioners for use in many applications. Wherever power management system is required, the 4x4 PRO USB SERIES provide the surge protection you need to keep your rack safe from unwanted disruption.All PRO USB SERIES models have an additional internal discrete module called APF (Advanced Power Filtering) which filters out digital and dimmer hash as well as any high frequency noise that is above the audio range. Some off-the-shelf add-on modules saturate and lose their filtering effectiveness as the load increases, but by using a high power discrete design we were able to create a filter that stays effective over the full operating range.By using both Common Mode and Differential Mode topologies in series for the filter design we are able to block virtually all of the unwanted noise that is between the AC line and ground, and also the two sides of the AC line. This has the additional benefit of reducing ground loop problems in your system. High frequency noise currents in particular are highly attenuated in both directions so that any line noise that could be generated by one of your components is not allowed to get back into your main A.C. wiring so if you use a number of PRO USB SERIES Power Conditioners in your setup, you can distribute and isolate the noisy components from the sensitiv'] ['APF - Advanced Power Filtering', 'Pull Out Light Pipes with AutoOff and Dimmer', 'Easy to read LED Input Voltage and Current Metering', 'Power Capacity of 1800 Watts', 'Surge & Spike Protection'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"22 x 9.9 x 3 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"7.45 Pounds\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Art Pro Audio\", \"Date First Available\": \"November 29, 2019\", \"Brand\": \"Art Pro Audio\", \"Compatible Devices\": \"Personal Computer\", \"Connector Type\": \"Usb\", \"Output Wattage\": \"1800 Watts\", \"Wattage\": \"1800 watts\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"22 x 9.9 x 3 inches\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The ferns featured on the stamps are five of the approximately 380 different species found in North America. Each of the five stamps depicts a close-up photograph of a different species of fern. The shapes and textures of the fronds stand out against a stark white background, highlighting the placement of the leaflets along each fern\u2019s stem. The name of each fern-autumn fern, Goldie\u2019s wood fern, soft shield fern, Fortune\u2019s holly fern, or painted fern-is placed vertically in capital letters along one edge of the stamp. Art director Phil Jordan created the stamp art by choosing five images from among dozens of existing pictures by photographer Cindy Dyer. After Dyer isolated the fronds in her photos, providing a white background, Jordan tightened the focus on each to fit within the stamp borders. He rotated some of the fronds to provide visual interest and oriented them in relation to one another to form a unified whole. The Ferns stamps add elegance to envelopes and are an exquisite continuation of the U.S. Postal Service\u2019s tradition of offering stamps that feature beautiful plants. Forever stamps are always equal in value to the current First-Class Mail one-ounce price. The piece is presented in an elegant silver-toned frame with gold accents.

This HD rear door carrier is designed to be highly adjustable and unbeatably beefy, giving you the freedom to mount oversize spare tires up to 37\" in diameter. The Jeep heavy-duty tire carrier is adjustable in two ways. First, the tire mount can be adjusted both vertically and horizontally. The vertical adjustment provides increased clearance for extra-large tires, eliminating bumper interference problems and allowing for up 37\" spare tires to be mounted on the carrier. The horizontal function moves the tire mount toward or away from the vehicle, ensuring clearance with the rear door. The second way the HD spare tire carrier is adjustable is in its third brake light bracket. The bracket can be moved up and down as needed. This allows you to maintain safety on and off the road by always keeping the third brake light fully visible, no matter how large the spare tire gets. To give the ARIES spare tire carrier adequate strength to hold large off-road tires, it comes with heavy-duty hinges. These hinges are designed to replace the existing Jeep JK door hinges with a heavier-duty option, strengthening the door and tire carrier for extreme off-roading. The hinges and the carrier itself install with no drilling required, utilizing the existing factory mounting points. The HD Jeep Wrangler tire carrier is also constructed from welded steel for maximum strength, and it features a highly durable, dual-layer E-coat and carbide black powder coat finish for superior rust resistance.'] ['Fit type: Vehicle Specific'] {\"Manufacturer\": \"Aries\", \"Brand\": \"ARIES\", \"Model\": \"\", \"Item Weight\": \"50.7 pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"30 x 7 x 18 inches\", \"Country of Origin\": \"China\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Exterior\": \" BLACK POWDER COAT\", \"Manufacturer Part Number\": \"\", \"OEM Part Number\": \"\", \"Date First Available\": \"August 3, 2017\", \"Material Carbon Steel\": \"\", \"\": \"Item Weight 50.7 Pounds\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"30 x 7 x 18 inches\", \"Is Foldable\": \"No\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

To be more exact, on the night of June 2nd, 1934. Mercedes built two newly-designed W25 vehicles for 1934 GP racing. They were registered to debut in the Eifel race at the N\u00fcrburgring on June 3. Mercedes was eager to become the world leader in racing again. The W25 vehicles were developed in accord with the 750Kg regulations, a new formula that was designed to mitigate the ongoing strife to develop high-speed cars by all means. The official weighing report that came out on the afternoon of June 2 must have stunned the Mercedes racing team. Painted in white, The classic German race color, the W25 were each found to be approximately 1 kilogram too heavy. This would disqualify them from the start line of the next day. Legend has it that Alfred Neubauer, the Chief of the Mercedes racing department, came up with a remedy. \"We have to remove the paint!\" Was his order. So the whole team set out to work feverishly throughout the night. When the cars were checked again The next day, The weight was just right. Neubauer\\'s idea had saved The day. Imagine the surprise when people saw the new looks of the German racing cars that were covered in an aluminum sheen! Both Manfred von Brauchitsch, the young Daredevil German driver, and Luigi fagioli, a cool-headed teammate from Italy, were geared up for the race. They were burning to put up a successful premier for the shiny W25 on June 3. The audience and the press could hardly believe their eyes when they first saw the radiant silvery rockets. After Brauchitsch raced his #20 car to the Championship in record time, the moniker \"silver arrow\" Spread like fire. Fagioli managed to stay in the top flight until the 13th lap, during which he had to retire. However, almost a year later, on April 22, 1935, it was his turn to carry the day at the GP of Monaco. He won the race in a 1935 version of the W25 with starting number 4.'] ['Hand-assembled precision metal model', 'Engine complete with all the aggregates, piping and cables', 'Extraordinary in the class of exquisite', 'Authentic replication of the 8-cylinder inline engine with vivid details', 'A great gift to display in the home or office'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"4 x 3 x 10 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"2.02 pounds\", \"Manufacturer recommended age\": \"14 years and up\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Manufacturer\": \"CMC-Classic Model Cars, USA\", \"Date First Available\": \"September 11, 2012\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Ultraviolet (UV) Filter Hoya Haze (UV) Filters are wise investments. They help protect your valuable investment from dust, moisture and scratches, which can lead to costly repairs. Circular Polarizing Filter Light rays which are reflected become polarized. Polarizing filters are used to select which light rays enter your camera lens. They can remove unwanted reflections from non-metallic surfaces such as water or glass and also saturate colors providing better contrast. The effect can be seen through the viewfinder and changed by rotating the filter. The filter factor varies according to how the filter is rotated and its orientation to the sun. Warming Filter (Intensifier) The Hoya Warming filter controls the bluish coloration that affects daylight film. They can also remove excessive blue from the effects of electronic flash. Reduces blue to green color and makes the color of human skin look more sun-tanned. Combination with Pro 1UV filter is recommended for outdoor shooting. Note! Circular polarizers are specifically designed for use with auto-focus SLR cameras (They will also work on manual systems and video cameras). UV Filters ? If desired they can be left on the lens at all times for protection ? Haze filters provide additional benefits of correction for Ultraviolet(UV) light which can register on film and videotape as a bluish cast and can obscure distant details ? Ultraviolet filters allow you to correct for the UV effect to varying degrees Circular Polarizing Filters ?

Please do not let the price point of this item fool you. Our goal was to manufacture a crazy loud and great sounding subwoofer. We started by testing subs by other brands that were retailing between the prices of $699 and $1999. One of our favorite subs was an old Mackie model called the AND . We loved the folded horn technology. The sub sounded great, packed a huge punch, and sounded as good as subs that cost twice the price. So our engineers decided on creating our sub with folded horn technology as well. When we were done manufacturing this thing, I was so blown away when I heard it. I do not believe there is a sub sounding this loud and this good even at triple our price. This sub should sell for $1199 or more.

The Radial JDI Duplex is a full-feature, stereo passive direct box designed to enhance connectivity, reduce noise, and simplify the hectic life of the touring professional, broadcast engineer or AV integrator. It is plug-and-play and easy to use while delivering the utmost sonic quality. Like the Radial JDI, the Duplex employs two high-performance 'made in the USA' audio transformers and the same pristine audio signal path that has made the JDI the industry standard. It features exceptional signal handling with virtually zero phase shift or harmonic distortion, while remaining linear across the entire audio spectrum. When driven to extremes, the natural transformer saturation and resulting warm Bessel curve makes the Radial Duplex the perfect choice for smoothing out highly dynamic instruments such as digital pianos and electronic drums that can sound harsh when pushed. Transformer isolation provides the additional benefit of eliminating troublesome ground loops that can cause hum and buzz in the audio system or interfere with video displays. This 'Swiss Army knife' DI is equipped with \u00bc' connectors for instruments, RCA connectors and a 3.5mm TRS for unbalanced -10dB consumer electronics plus XLR inputs for +4dB professional line sources. Radial's innovative book-end design provides protective zones on the front and rear to keep connectors and switches out of harm's way. The 14 gauge I-beam inner frame adds tremendous rigidity to eliminate outside stresses that could torque the PC board and cause premature solder joint and trace failure. The steel outer shell couples with the transformer's mu-metal shield to protect against stray magnetic fields from power transformers or lighting systems that could cause interference.

Together with PJB\u2019s Chrome-Dome speaker technology it provides far greater transient attack from improved loudspeaker cone acceleration, greater dynamic range, and lower harmonic distortion. It will provide increased headroom and speed to capture every nuance of bass playing, from gentle fingerstyle to hardcore slapping. The speaker design and efficiency is the result of PJB\u2019s commitment to driver research at Phil Jones\u2019s laboratory that features a Klippel laser measurement system and a massive anechoic chamber. As a stand alone combo the Bass Cub Pro will deliver 120 watts RMS into the internal speakers and will increase to 240 watts RMS with the addition of an extension cabinet. The pre amp is a 5 band eq single channel unit with Low Bass, High Bass, Mid-Range, Low Treble and High Treble controls with +/- 18dB of boost or cut on each control. The cabinet is constructed of solidly braced Baltic birch plywood and is appointed with luxury \u201ctolex\u201d covering with color options of both Burgundy Red and Black. The input has a switchable gain (for active and passive basses), mute switch, and LED clip indicator which will accurately match all bass instruments.

An auxiliary input has a level control for quick mixing of external devises such as a drum machine or iPod/MP3 player, which are audible through the stereo Headphone Socket or speakers.

Woodpeckers new Clamping Square Plus is longer, wider and stronger than our original design, giving you better performance for the same price. In our new CSP design we incorporated a series of 3/8\u201d holes, then designed our new CSP Clamp to drop easily into any of the holes and secure the square faster and easier than separate \u201cF\u201d or \u201cC\u201d style clamps. After we finished the CSP Clamps it occurred to the team that you would need a place to keep all these squares and clamps handy, so we came up with the CSP Clamp Rack-It. It\u2019ll keep your squares and clamps right where you need them. Notice that Woodpeckers Clamping Squares PLUS work either inside or outside the workpieces. Take a look at the inside corner, too. You\u2019ll see a relief cut that won\u2019t bind on your stock if something is cut just a wee bit out of square. Speaking of square, these assembly tools are CNC machined out of one solid chunk of aluminum to a tolerance of \u00b1 .0255 degrees! The square legs are 1-1/4\u201d wide, 6-3/4\u201d long, and 3/4\u201d thick. We designed the new CSP Clamps as the perfect companion for the Clamping Squares Plus. They\u2019re more convenient than separate clamps, locking directly into the holes on the squares. The large, easy-to-grip knobs tighten more securely than the round handles found on most clamps. The extruded aluminum clamping jaw won\u2019t mar your stock with normal clamping pressure. The fast running Acme thread spins down quickly and locks down tight. The CSP Clamps work with material as thin as 3/16\u201d and up to a full 2\u201d.'] ['Clamping Squares Plus Clamps', '4 Pairs of Clamps and 4 Individual Clamping Squares Plus'] {\"Manufacturer\": \"Woodpeckers LLC\", \"Item Weight\": \"8 pounds\", \"Package Dimensions\": \"12 x 10 x 4 inches\", \"Color\": \"Red Metallic\", \"Style\": \"Modern\", \"Material\": \"Aluminum\", \"Horsepower\": \"1 hp\", \"Date First Available\": \"March 19, 2019\", \"Brand\": \"Woodpeckers\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}
