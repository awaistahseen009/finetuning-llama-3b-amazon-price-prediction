The WA-14 utilizes a custom all-brass CK12-style capsule, CineMag USA transformer, and a fully discrete signal path. The WA-14 can be used on an array of sources, such as; punchy/warm intimate lead vocals, acoustic/electric guitars, bass, drums/percussion, strings/orchestral material, and many other sources. The WA-14 provides a realism and thickness that is true to the vintage microphone, but now at an affordable price. All Brass Capsule The WA-12-B-60V is an all-brass, edge-terminated capsule that captures all the smoothness, rich top end, and warm vintage sonics of the original CK12 capsule. The WA-12-B-60V uses a variant CEK-12 back plate as a basis, which overcomes manufacturing limitations of the original CK12 capsule. The o-ring and housing of the WA-12-B-60V are all made from brass (no teflon parts), and the diaphragm is 24k gold sputtered 6 micron, NOS PET film (mylar). The end result is a very consistent, reliable capsule which matches the frequency response and tonality of the classic 1970's classic capsule. Born Out Of Need When designing our first microphone we knew that the single greatest challenge would be to offer a capsule that was built to a high standard and priced in a range that every-day musicians and engineers could afford. We already knew where to find great microphone transformers, precision resistors, polystyrene, tantalum and WIMA film capacitors; but we came to realize that a quality affordable microphone capsule that met our specifications simply wasn\u2019t out there. We knew we would have to develop our own line of capsules. The WA (Warm Audio) brand of capsule is the result of several years of research, a lifetime of listening, and a passion for great sound. Above all else, Warm Audio capsules came from the desire to give customers far more quality/value than what they are used to getting in an affordable microphone. Every Warm Audio capsule is made in the same small assembly house in a clean-room environment, and packaged in its own protective jewel case until the moment it is loaded into the microphone. Every capsule visually inspected and electrically tested for imperfections. Every capsule is also made with all brass parts (no teflon or other cost saving material), and is carefully skinned from the same supply of high purity NOS Mylar (PET film). We are confident that you will be just as pleased with our microphone capsules as we are to offer them, and that they will give you a lifetime of great recordings and enjoyment.\"] ['Custom CineMag USA Transformer', 'Polar Patterns: Cardioid, Figure Of Eight And Omnidirectional', 'Features Custom WA-12-B-60V Edge-Terminated, Dual-Backplate, All-Brass Vintage CK12-Style Capsule', 'Output Pad: 0dB, -10dB, -20dB', 'Frequency Range: 20Hz To 20kHz'] {\"Item Weight\": \"6.3 ounces\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"11.5 x 8.4 x 4.25 inches\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"May 5, 2017\", \"Color Name\": \"Black with silver grille\", \"Connector Type\": \"XLR\", \"Material Type\": \"Silver\", \"Power Source\": \"Electric\", \"Brand\": \"Warm Audio\", \"Model Name\": \"WA-14\", \"Connectivity Technology\": \"XLR\", \"Color\": \"Black with silver grille\", \"Included Components\": \"Protective Zipper Pouch, Hard Mount, Shock Mount\", \"Polar Pattern\": \"Multipattern\", \"Impedance\": \"150 Ohm\", \"Microphone Form Factor\": \"Microphone Only\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"11.5 x 8.4 x 4.25 inches\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The PRS HDRX 20 features a newly-documented \u201cAuthentic Hendrix\u201d Touring Circuit. This circuit is heavily inspired by one of Hendrix\u2019s personal amps, purportedly used at Woodstock, which Paul Reed Smith and PRS Amp Designer Doug Sewell were able to study in 2018. Designed to push the high-end so it is very clear, but not so much that it\u2019s harsh, the PRS HDRX shines without glaring and allows for aggression that can be backed off for smooth, sweet tones. The PRS HDRX 20 is driven by two 5881 power tubes. Chosen for their lower power, smaller size, and organic voice, the 5881 tubes bring thick but articulate tone that drives well and breaks up beautifully in this lower-wattage amp. The PRS HDRX 20 features a 3-band TMB tone stack, 2-way bright switch, high-mid gain switch, and presence controls. These features mirror the historic amp and give players flexibility and increased control of their tone. The PRS HDRX 20 is also designed with internally bridged channels with individual treble and bass volume controls. This eliminates the need for a jumper cable (historically used on the outside of the amp) and allows players to dial in their distortion level and tone more easily by blending the lead and bass channels\u2019 individual volume controls, bringing more modern convenience to the amp. The addition of a Master Volume control on the HDRX 20, a new feature for HDRX amps, is another modern convenience. Players can use the Master Volume to control the power amp section of the HDRX, making it more user friendly for players who do not want to add a volume attenuator to their setup.'] ['Features a 3-band TMB tone stack, 2-way bright switch, high-mid gain switch, and presence controls', 'Designed with internally bridged channels with individual treble and bass volume controls.', 'Master Volume control addition', 'Heavily inspired by one of Hendrix\u2019s personal amps'] {\"Item Weight\": \"28.45 Pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"23.2 x 14.6 x 14.9 inches\", \"Date First Available\": \"August 19, 2022\", \"Compatible Devices\": \"Guitar\", \"Output Wattage\": \"20 Watts\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Brand\": \"PRS Guitars\", \"Number of Bands\": \"2\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Our innovative panels have been designed to totally rid you of the need to hire professional siding installers, or skilled labor. Each of our easily managed, lightweight panels weighs only about one pound per square foot, removing the need to pay for that additional equipment and labor. It only takes one or two people using basic hand or power tools to install NextStone products with ease. Requiring only screws and adhesive with panels that can be easily cut using everyday woodworking tools, installing NextStone is a snap and can give you big savings when it comes to achieving the classic stone look you desire. NextStone is a cost effective alternative to real or cast stone. Installing NextStone exterior siding can save construction-workers and everyday homeowners a substantial amount of money when it comes to improving residential and commercial buildings. Especially when compared to installing much more expensive natural rock, brick or stone veneers. The installation time and cost for our products are significantly less than that of installing traditional masonry, increasing the amount of money you save when you decide to remodel your home or business. NextStone panels weigh about one pound per square foot can be handled easily by a single installer. NextStone is durable and resistant to weathering. The toughness of NextStone replicated stone siding means that you don\u2019t have to worry no matter what climate you live in.

The motto: never adjust in the night again - whith the Astromania artificial Star, a star for testing and adjusting is always at your hand: Here the adjustment of the telescope is much more accurately than at night, as you work in closed rooms and have no problem with air turbulence. Furthermore, it is always a problem to make use of tools in front of the optics when it\u00b4s dark. Something can be dropped too easily and then ... Practical tip from Astromania-Service: In order to collimate a telescope or to detect optical aberrations such as astigmatism or coma you need only a short distance between the telescope and the artificial star. In these cases due to the extended focal plane you may need extension tubes in order to reach focus. Dpherical aberration is very difficult to detect using an artificial star. You should set up the star at a much greater distance from the telescope. We recommend a distance in meters that is equal to one third of the aperture in millimeters. For instance, for a telescope with 200 mm aperture you should set up the artificial star at least 66 m away from the telescope. Here we recommend using a real star.

Equipped with an 11\u201d articulating arm, dual ring lights, and variable focal length, this microscope can be the perfect tool for laboratories, production lines, and repair stations. Optics The internal focusing system uses variable focal length to change both the magnification and working distance. At its lowest position, the microscope produces its maximum magnification. As the microscope\u2019s height is increased, the magnification decreases to provide a larger field of view -- up to 52mm x 29.4mm with the arm fully extended. The final magnification of the displayed image is determined by the size of the monitor being used, as can be seen in the table below.

A mini-HDMI connector allows you to display live 1080p images on a digital monitor or television, using the microscope\u2019s internal software to control resolution, exposure, white-balance, and more. Photos and videos are recorded directly to MicroSD media in standard JPG and MOV formats. The microscope can also be used with your PC via USB. The included software allows you to capture photos and videos to your computer, and provides basic image processing, editing and measurement tools. 11\" Articulating Arm Stand With a 7\u201d x 11\u201d footprint, the microscope is ideal for any workspace. The triple-joint 11\u201d articulating arm allows you to quickly adjust the microscope\u2019s height and angle, and uses a single locking knob to secure its position. The flexibility of the arm allows you to view objects from any angle. Illumination The highly flexible illumination system uses dual LED ring lights to ensure every detail is captured.

With Relay Recording, the camcorder automatically switches video recording from the internal drive to the SD memory card when the memory becomes full. There's no need to worry about running out of recording time during a thrilling, once-in-a-lifetime shot. You'll also have the flexibility of copying video from your VIXIA HF M31's internal drive to the removable SD memory card. That makes it easy to insert the card into your computer or HDTV's card reader and view your recorded footage immediately. The advantages of flash memory go beyond the added recording time. You'll also appreciate the quick response time, because there are no moving parts. In addition, when you review, you'll have quick access to your footage. Another plus is the VIXIA HF M31's low power consumption rate, allowing your battery to last longer. And if your HF M31 happens to slip, or you accidentally knock it against something, you'll be happy to know that flash memory makes your camcorder more shock-resistant than other recording storage systems.

The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-90x. The 5MP camera has a CMOS color sensor, a reduction lens, image capture and editing software, and USB 2.0 output to capture or display still or video images on a computer or projector. The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port. The WH10x20mm super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces combine with the 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective to provide zoom magnification and a longer working distance for inspecting large-scale specimens that require handling or repair.

A Barlow lens with a magnification of less than 1.0 reduces magnification and increases the working distance, while a Barlow lens with a magnification greater than 1.0 increases the magnification and reduces the working distance. High-eyepoint eyepieces ease viewing for users who wear glasses, and dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences.

The internal Optical SteadyShot (OSS) image stabilization system with Active Mode offers effective stabilization even at the wide end of the zoom range when shooting movies. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This \u2018bokeh\u2019 effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light. \u03b1 lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped \u201caspherical\u201d elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. The distance encoder plays an integral part in ADI flash metering, which delivers high precision flash metering that is unaffected by the reflectance of subjects or backgrounds. The distance encoder is a lens component that directly detects the position of the focusing mechanism, and sends a signal to the CPU in order to measure distance to the subject. During flash photography, this data is v ['Minimum Focus Distance:0.99 (Wide) -1.64 feet (Tele) (0.3 (Wide) -0.5 m (Tele))', 'Direct Manual Focus with non-rotating focus ring during AF- ideal for precise, comfortable manual focus adjustments'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"3.9 x 3.66 x 3.66 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"1.43 pounds\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"September 9, 2010\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Sony\", \"Country of Origin\": \"China\", \"Brand\": \"Sony\", \"Focal Length Description\": \"18-200 millimeters\", \"Lens Type\": \"Telephoto, Wide Angle\", \"Compatible Mountings\": \"Sony E\", \"Camera Lens Description\": \"200 month\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The WA-47jr is fully discrete, has 3 polar patterns and is designed for pro studio, home studio, live, and broadcast applications. The WA-47jr sounds great on vocals, acoustic/electric guitars, acoustic/electric bass, drums, piano, strings, brass/woodwind instruments, and an array of other sources.', 'From the Manufacturer', \"The WA-47jr is an FET transformerless version of the highly renowned classic \u201847 microphone that has been used on countless hit records for the last 50+ years. The WA-47jr is fully discrete, has 3 polar patterns and is designed for pro studio, home studio, live, and broadcast applications. The WA-47jr sounds great on vocals, acoustic/electric guitars, acoustic/electric bass, drums, piano, strings, brass/woodwind instruments, and an array of other sources. The WA-47jr proudly utilizes a custom k47 style capsule reproduction, designed with the same hole pattern and frequency response as the vintage design. Our version of this capsule (model# WA-47-B-80v) is carefully manufactured by an Australian capsule manufacturer with careful precision and repeat-ability that allows the most important sonic piece of the classic mic to be heard and influence the tone and signature of the WA-47jr. The WA-47jr's low-noise and discrete signal path, when paired with this excellent true '47 style capsule, allows it to obtain a very similar tone to the classic \u201847 microphone, but at a much lower price tag. The WA-47jr utilizes the same k47 style capsule found in our flagship WA-47 tube condenser microphone. The WA-47jr circuit uses high quality Toshiba FET\u2019s, Wima film capacitors and Panasonic electrolytic capacitors. The circuit is modernized and more simple than the classic \u201847 tube microphone, but the components and circuitry are top-notch, and have a sound quality and tone that punches far above anything we\u2019ve ever heard in this price range.
