Designed to provide a simple and effective process for accurately capturing measurements of power consumption, Series 2000 Meters are easy to specify and install for new construction and retrofits. Leviton meters utilize highly accurate current transformers for revenue-grade performance certified to ANSI standards. Competing products use current sensors that do not provide the same level of performance. Leviton offers CTs in solid and split core styles to accommodate all phases of installation and construction. Solid core CTs are ideal for new construction, when power is not live and wires can easily be threaded through the core. Split core CTs can be installed at any time without having to disconnect wire terminations, making them the optimal choice for retrofitting an existing structure. Split core CTs close securely for fast, precise installation with no need for time-consuming tie wraps and no worries about improper seating or core half separation. Both solid and split core CTs offer high quality, long term accuracy and reliability. Every Series 2000 Meter has an installer-friendly feedback feature. The red reverse phase indicator acts as an installation diagnostics tool and illuminates if a meter is improperly installed. After installation, the green duty cycle light shows that the meter is collecting electrical consumption data at the appropriate rate.

This is supported with a feedback eliminating notch filter with variable frequency sweep control and choice of normal and extra deep notch filtering. To help eliminate troublesome resonance, a dual slope low cut (high pass filter) is also provided. An internal polarity reverse can also be engaged to help eliminate run-away feedback. To augment on-stage performance, the PZ-Pre Direct Box Preamp is equipped with a combination power booster and effects loop bus. This allows you to introduce an effect such as a chorus, or boost the signal for soloing with a simple foot stomp.

Repositionable thermal labels can stick to virtually any surface and can be removed easily and reapplied leaving behind no residue. The liner-free labels are an alternative to using silicone-lined labels or tape. Since they do not use silicone liners, liner-free labels eliminate negative environmental impact and help cut back on in-house waste, thus continuing the Star Micronics Global Green Initiative which encompasses manufacturing products that provide minimal impact on our environment. Liner-free labels are a welcomed addition for quick service restaurants (QSR) applications, from drive-through service to self-service deli applications. The liner-free labels can be used for a modified item only or the entire order by attaching it to the bag. The labels can stay with and track an order through the entire preparation process, improving both drive-through, and takeout order accuracy, and creating a better bottom line. The labels also maintain image integrity because they are engineered to preserve thermal images in demanding applications. The taken sensor, available on the , helps users avoid missing any orders and allows for flexible, efficient operations in the kitchen. The sensor's paper holding function delays printing the next order's data if the previous ticket has not been taken, allowing users to manage each order efficiently, especially during busy times when many orders are received. The taken sensor also includes a forced paper ejection setting, which forces the next order to print after a certain amount of time, in the event that a user forgot to remove a ticket.

The Headlight is a unity gain guitar amp selector designed to easily integrate on a pedalboard and allow the artist to seamlessly switch between as many as four amps using a single footswitch. The magic behind the compact design is the combination of 1/4-in. switching output jacks and an innovative sequential footswitch that advances through the connected outputs depending on how many amps are connected. You merely stomp on the footswitch to go from one output to the next. This enables the Headlight to be used with one, two, three or even four amps. High visibility LEDs provide instant output status on busy stages. The design begins with Radial\u2019s legendary Class-A input buffer for optimal signal transfer and minimal distortion without artefact. Drag Control load correction is used to replicate the tone and feel as if connected directly to an amplifier. The signal is then sent to the four outputs, three of which are transformer isolated to prevent hum and buzz caused by ground loops. Each output is augmented with a ground lift switch to further aid in reducing nose. To ensure all amplifiers play in phase, 180-degree polarity reverse switches may be set as needed. A mute footswitch works double duty as either a mute that turns off all the outputs except for the dedicated tuner out or as an \"all-on\" switch if driving multiple amps at the same time is desired. The Headlight follows Radial\u2019s pedigree for exceptional build quality with 14-gauge steel construction throughout. This not only protects the sensitive inner workings from outside stress, it also helps prevent noise from nearby magnetic fields from polluting the inner workings. To accommodate pedalboards, the Headlight is powered by a standard 9V supply for easy integration with a multi-pedal power brick. The Headlight delivers the perfect balance between compact size, easy functionality and great tone.'] ['Four output guitar amp selector with sequential switching Class-A input buffer with Drag Control load correction Isolated outputs to eliminate hum and buzz from ground loops Mute switch and tuner out for quiet on-stage tuning', 'The Headlight is a unity gain guitar amp selector designed to easily integrate on a pedalboard and allow the artist to seamlessly switch between as many as four amps using a single footswitch', 'The magic behind the compact design is the combination of 1/4-in', 'switching output jacks and an innovative sequential footswitch that advances through the connected outputs depending on how many amps are connected', 'You merely stomp on the footswitch to go from one output to the next'] {\"Item Weight\": \"2.25 Pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"6.75 x 5.25 x 2.5 inches\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"November 16, 2016\", \"Compatible Devices\": \"Guitar\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Brand\": \"Radial Engineering\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-90x. The 10MP camera has a CMOS color sensor, a reduction lens, image capture and editing software, and USB 2.0 output to capture or display still or video images on a computer or projector. The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port.

A Barlow lens with a magnification of less than 1.0 reduces magnification and increases the working distance, while a Barlow lens with a magnification greater than 1.0 increases the magnification and reduces the working distance. High-eyepoint eyepieces ease viewing for users who wear glasses, and dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences.

Plus, the DMR-E50 is a great DVD player too, with progressive-scan output for an improved picture with an HD-compatible TV. Product Overview: The Panasonic DMR-E50 can record video and audio to blank DVD discs, using DVD-RAM (rewritable) and DVD-R (record once) discs. The unit has three line inputs, two on the rear and one on the front, and a built-in TV tuner, which is programmable for time shift recording of TV shows (just like a VCR). TV Tuner: The DVD recorder has a built-in 181-channel TV tuner. Like a VCR records to a VHS cassette, TV shows can be recorded to DVD-RAM or DVD-R with this unit.

When recording onto a DVD-R disc, the video is recorded in regular 4:3, regardless of the video signal input.
