The FC-40 makes use of the control circuitry built into the transceiver, which allows the operator to control and monitor automatic operation of the FC-40, which mounts near the antenna feedpoint. The FC-40 uses specially-selected, thermallystable components, and is housed in a waterproof case to withstand severe environmental conditions with high reliability. A carefully-chosen combination of solid-state switching components and high-speed relays allows the FC-40 to match a wide variety of antennas to within a 2:1 SWR on any amateur band frequency (160 through 5 meters), typically in less than ten seconds. Transmitter power required for matching may be as little as 4 - 60 Watts, and matching settings are automatically stored in memory for instant recall when the same frequency range is selected later. Rugged, low-loss components are employed throughout the FC-40, to ensure reliable operation for many years in a wide range of environmental situations.

The hl-85-led-cpr super bright 10 million hand Candlepower Spotlight from Larson Electronics is lightweight, ultra-durable, and features a comfortable ergonomic design. This unit uses seven high output CREE LEDs and an advanced reflector and lens configuration to generate 2,000 lumens with a beam range of over 1,600 feet while drawing only 36 watts of power. Equipped with a cigarette lighter socket that operates on 12 - 24 V DC, this IP67 waterproof spotlight is ideal for hunting, camping, marine and boating use, as well as for first responders and emergency services. Features: The HL-85-LED-CPR super bright handheld spotlight delivers an impressive 2,000 lumens while drawing only 36 watts of power. With a combination of seven high-output CREE LEDs and a 5\" reflector beam, this Spotlight cuts through the darkness with a length of over 1,600 feet. The CREE LED units in this light have been Chosen for their high lumens per watt ratio and extreme longevity, these CREE LED bulbs generate 56 lumens per watt effective lumen retention output and have a 70% Lumens at 50,000 hours giving them an efficiency and lifespan that exceeds traditional light sources.The unique shape and low contour of the 120mm reflector lens is paired with a convex lens and position to efficiently capture and project a focused beam of light while reducing light spillage and residue which is common with many spotlights.This design also reduces casting, a phenomenon that occurs when efficient light waste \"spills\" around the light source. Many times, when surrounded by water, snow or other reflective surfaces, this spill light prevents the human eye from properly adjusting and seeing objects at a distance. With the HL-85-LED-CPR Spotlight, 90% of the light emitted from your setup is captured and objects are clearly, sharply and centeredly illuminated all the way to the end of the reach beam.'] {\"Item Weight\": \"2 pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"9 x 9 x 9 inches\", \"Style\": \"Traditional\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Voltage\": \"24 Volts\", \"Wattage\": \"36 watts\", \"Type of Bulb\": \"LED\", \"Mounting Type\": \"Floor Mount\", \"Plug Format\": \"A- US style\", \"Date First Available\": \"January 9, 2017\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Upgrade your existing star diagonal to this premium one and enjoy brighter, sharper images without purchasing an entirely new telescope. This star diagonal reflects the telescope\u2019s light path 90\u00b0 to provide a more comfortable viewing angle. In addition, the glass has 58 layers of dielectric coatings, which provide an over 99% reflective surface, delivering the maximum amount of light to the eyepiece. This 2\u201d star diagonal has the added benefit of allowing you to use larger 2\u201d eyepieces with your telescope, providing a wider field of view, or standard 1. 25\u201d eyepieces with the stepdown adapter. The twist-lock eyepiece holder secures eyepieces while keeping them centered in the diagonal, thus providing best opto-mechanical alignment between the telescope and eyepiece. Unlike traditional thumb screws, the twist-lock cannot scratch or engrave the barrel of your eyepieces. The diagonal has an integrated 2\u201d barrel stop that prevents 2\u201d accessories with long barrels from damaging the mirror. All the diagonal\u2019s mechanical parts are made of machined black anodized aluminum, except the twist lock rings, which are orange anodized for visibility. The interior of the Schmidt-Cassegrain adapter and 2\u201d barrel are glare threaded and painted flat black to prevent glare. With all its features and these high-end finishes, the Celestron Dielectric Star Diagonal, 2\u201d with Twist-Lock is one of the highest quality 2\" star diagonals that Celestron has ever offered. This diagonal also comes with two interchangeable barrels to provide flexibility in connecting the diagonal to a wide variety of telescopes without the need for additional adapters. For telescopes, like refractors, which accept 2\u201d barrels in their focuser, a standard 2\u201d barrel is included. For Schmidt-Cass grains (SCTs) that use a threaded connection to the focuser, a barrel with SCT threads is included. Both barrels thread onto the diagonal housing, providing a secure connection to the diagonal. The key specifications for a star diagonal are its reflectivity and its optical quality. This diagonal delivers top performance in both categories, with an over 99% reflective mirror and diffraction-limited optical quality. This ensures that virtually all the light collected by the telescope will reach the eyepiece without the diagonal affecting optical performance. Using a lower quality star diagonal can both dim the view and degrade optical quality. You can enjoy better views from your telescope by simply swapping out its diagonal for a premium one, like the Celestron Dielectric Star Diagonal.'] ['Enjoy better views through your telescope with this premium diagonal featuring diffraction-limited optics and dielectric coatings', 'Provides a 90\u00b0 viewing angle, perfect for more comfortable viewing through refractor and cass grain-type telescopes', '58 layers of dielectric coatings provide an over 99% reflective surface, ensuring the maximum amount of light collected by the telescope reaches the eyepiece', 'Twist-lock keeps the eyepiece centered in the diagonal to provide better optical alignment', 'Includes a Stepdown adapter, so the diagonal accepts eyepieces, Barlow lenses, threaded filters, and other accessories in both 2\u201d and 1. 25\u201d sizes'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"3.15 x 3.15 x 4.72 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"1.55 Pounds\", \"Date First Available\": \"July 24, 2019\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Celestron\", \"Country of Origin\": \"China\", \"Brand\": \"Celestron\", \"Model Name\": \"93573\", \"Eye Piece Lens Description\": \"Barlow\", \"Objective Lens Diameter\": \"51 \\tmonths\", \"Focus Type\": \"Manual Focus\", \"Finderscope\": \"Reflex\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Accumulator Groove: Is a V shaped groove machined in the 2nd ring land to collect excess blow-by between the top and second ring. This groove collects residual gasses during combustion and alleviates top ring flutter while increasing ring seal. CP groove: stands for Constant Pressure Groove. This groove works as a channel on the lower part of the top land that equalizes pressure to the back of the top ring groove. When used in combination with lateral gas ports, the CP groove helps keep gas ports clear of carbon build up. In addition, the CP groove prevents the top land from smudging into the top ring if the land rubs the cylinder bore.

Everything you need to start playing immediately comes in one box. Save yourself the hassle and save some money while you're at it. When it comes to mixing, honesty is the key. You don't want studio monitors that sound great all the time because once you take that mix into your car or home stereo it will sound completely different. In the same vein if your monitors are made to emphasize the bass response, then you will mix the bass too low. Accuracy is crucial, and the Yamaha HS8's continue in the tradition of the industry respected NS 10's, the best / worst sounding monitors (worst because you'll hear the good AND bad in your mix!).The 2-way bass reflex bi-amplification is what makes most electric and sonic sense. Bi-amplification means that separate power amplifiers are used to drive the low-mid and high frequency speaker units, which eliminates any phase anomalies and lets both speakers perform at optimum levels. This in turn gives you the transparency you desire for your mix.The drivers used in the HS series monitors deliver superb audio performance that is enhanced by a sophisticated mounting system. A mathematical arrangement of screws and a specially designed mounting ring eliminates unwanted vibration and resonance, which lets the speaker realize its full sonic potential, without distortion or coloration. Another great feature that you will hear but won't see are the extra-large magnets. Used with a state of the art circuit design these magnets provide powerful, yet tightly controlled flux field that gives you an especially smooth response and dynamics over a wider range of frequencies.SKU: YAM-HS8Model Number: HS8\"] ['38Hz - 30kHz frequency response', '75W LF plus 45W HF bi-amp system for high-performance 120W power amplification', '8-inch cone woofer, 1-inch dome tweeter', 'Large magnets in an Advanced Magnetic Circuit design', 'Bundles includes a pair of two monitors'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"15.75 x 19.69 x 15.75 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"56 Pounds\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"August 27, 2013\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Yamaha\", \"Speakers Maximum Output Power\": \"120 Watts\", \"Brand\": \"Yamaha\", \"Speaker Type\": \"Woofer\", \"Special Feature\": \"Portable\", \"Recommended Uses For Product\": \"Car\", \"Mounting Type\": \"Car Mount,Magnetic Mount\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The XDT16Z offers users four speeds, As well as Makita\u2019s exclusive Quick-Shift mode for increased fastening control. Quick-shift mode uses the Brushless motor\u2019s electronic controls to find the best balance of speed and torque for each application for more efficient fastening. Another precision setting is tightening mode (t-mode), which downshifts and reduces rotation and impact speed prior to driving the screw into place, and is engineered to minimize screw thread stripping, screw breakage and damage to work. The XDT16Z delivers industry-leading performance in a compact and ergonomic design. Added features include the one-touch 4-speed power selector button under the chuck, which enables one-handed speed changes, and reverse rotation auto-stop mode which stops rotation and impact when the fastener is loosened adequately to help prevent over-loosening and dropped fasteners. It\u2019s part of Makita\u2019s expanding 18V LXT system, the world\u2019s largest cordless tool system powered by 18V Lithium-Ion batteries. Makita 18V LXT batteries have the fastest charge times in their categories, so they spend more time working and less time sitting on the charger.

KAT Percussion has collaborated with REMO, the world-renowned drumhead brand, to equip the KT-300 with REMO mesh heads.\\x9fThe sensitivity of the pads combined with the REMO mesh heads create a very large velocity curve for the hardest player or the softest touch. Tested to over 1 million strokes, these heads are about as durable as they come, and will last an extremely long time. Enhanced by the latest Dual-Triggering technology, with zones at the head and at the rim, the KT-300's 10\u2033 KT-30010S snare and the 8\u2033 KT-3008T toms provide\\x9faccurate triggering and\\x9fa large strike area. The tone changes depending on where and how hard you strike, ensuring the most realistic playing feel. This technology combines with the mesh heads to give the player an authentic acoustic feel. The hi-hat and two crash cymbals are 12\u2033 and are two-zone with choke. The ride is 14\u2033 and is a three-zone cymbal with choke. All cymbals that come with the KT-300 are full surface e-cymbals meaning they are a full rubber build, not a rubber and plastic combo. With the advanced velocity-sensitive cymbals,\\x9fyou can set parameters for your triggers to ensure the most accurate and natural response. The KT-300 ships with 30 sets of preset kits, as well as 18 sets of user kits that you can truly get creative with.\\x9fJust turn the knob and hit the pad\\x9fto call up the sound\\x9fassigned to it, use the UP and DOWN button to select the instrument, and edit it the way you want.

Zuiko Digital ED 9-18mm F4.0-5.6 (35mm equivalent 18-36mm) lens is designed to maximize the performance advantages of the Micro Four Thirds System, and it's significantly lighter and more compact--easily fitting in a jacket pocket. The new lens, made with ED (extra-low dispersion) glass for superior image quality, complements the design of the PEN cameras, including the powerfully simple E-PL1, making it the all-in-one package for consumers with any skill level, including those who are new to photography. The Micro Four Thirds System standard meets the telecentric requirements of dedicated digital design. Light rays strike the imaging element nearly head-on for optimum edge-to-edge image reproduction. It also enables much more compact design than the Four Thirds System standard (or other interchangeable lens systems) because it reduces the outer diameter of the lens mount by 6mm, and the distance from the lens mount to the sensor (the flange back distance) by approximately half. As a result, M. Zuiko Digital Micro Four Thirds System lenses offer uncompromising professional quality for capturing both still-images and High-Definition (HD) videos, and the lenses are exceptionally compact to make capturing your life more fun. The super wide-angle M. Zuiko Digital ED 9-18mm F4.0-5.6 zoom lens (35mm equivalent 18-36mm) offers a 100 percent angle of view, and overturns the rule that super wide-angle zooms have to be big and heavy. With a length of just 49mm and a weight of just 155g, it is less than half the size and 60 percent of the weight of the ZUIKO Digital ED 9-18mm F4.0-5.6. With its wide angle of view, including background scenery in group photos is a snap, and it can be used to create unique images with a sense of dramatically exaggerated perspective. By maximizing the advantages of the Micro Four Thirds System design, compact size, low weight and amazing image quality, the new lens significantly expand the photographic potential of the system. The inner focusing mechanism uses a light, compact, single-element unit to enable exceptionally fast, quiet autofocusing for smooth, superior operating ease during still and video capture. The manual focusing mechanism is designed to offer a responsive feel and precise operation, enabling you an affordable, high-quality means to capture your life in stills or HD videos. The 9-18mm lens also offers quieter and more responsive AF performance, and provide professional image quality for capturing amazing still images and videos. It is compatible with all Micro Four Thirds System Olympus PEN cameras, and all other current and future cameras that comply with the Micro Four Thirds System standard. When mounted on an Olympus PEN camera, the lens is stabilized thanks to the camera's in-body Image Stabilization system and offer effective shake compensation at all focal lengths.\"] ['Wide-angle zoom lens is designed for Micro Four Thirds mirrorless cameras and provides an 18-36mm equivalent focal length range.', 'Two Dual Super Aspherical elements, along with one high refractive index element and an aspherical element, reduce spherical aberrations and distortions throughout the zoom range for improved sharpness with minimal distortion.', 'One extra-low dispersion element suppresses color fringing and chromatic aberrations for greater clarity and color accuracy.', 'Movie & Still Compatible (MSC) autofocus system benefits both photo and video applications due to its smooth, quiet, and fast performance.', 'Retractable lens design with a locking button maintains a compact profile when the lens is not in use.'] {\"Product Dimensions\": \"1.97 x 2.24 x 2.24 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"5.5 ounces\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"February 2, 2010\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Olympus\", \"Country of Orig"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}
