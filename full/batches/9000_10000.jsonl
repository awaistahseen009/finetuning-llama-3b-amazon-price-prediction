The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-180x. The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port (camera sold separately). The WH10x20mm and WH20x10mm super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces combine with the 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective to provide continuous zoom magnification and a longer working distance for inspecting large-scale specimens that require handling or repair. The microscope comes with 0.5x and 2.0x Barlow lenses that can be added to the objective to increase the magnification range. A Barlow lens with a magnification of less than 1.0 reduces magnification and increases the working distance, while a Barlow lens with a magnification greater than 1.0 increases the magnification and reduces the working distance. High-eyepoint eyepieces ease viewing for users who wear glasses, and dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. A stereo microscope, sometimes called an inspection or dissection microscope, has low magnification and a long working distance that enables users to manipulate the object being inspected.', 'The microscope has upper (episcopic) illumination that reflects light off the specimen for enhanced visibility of opaque specimens, and lower (diascopic) illumination that transmits light up through the specimen for enhanced visibility of translucent and transparent objects. The upper LED ring light provides shadow-free illumination, and can be removed to provide access to the objectives. A frosted stage plate allows light to pass through from below with transparent specimens, a reversible black and white stage plate provides contrast with light- and dark-colored specimens, and stage clips secure the specimen during viewing. Both lights have a rheostat to control the amount of light emanating from the lamp. The pillar-style stand has bilateral coarse focus to ease use for left- and right-handed users.

However, the quality differences between filters are huge. If you have an expensive lens, you do not want to run the risk of image quality losses due to inferior filters.

Over the past four-plus decades there\u2019s a resounding theme from Taylor Guitars: passion for improving the guitar-playing experience. As a company that\u2019s passionate about exposing more players to the pleasures of making music, Taylor isn\u2019t content to see people throw in the towel before they have a chance to get their groove on. The Academy Series, which includes the Academy 10 Dreadnought acoustic, represents Taylor\u2019s effort to support the development of the entry-level guitar player.

But all too often this ends in hand-wringing frustration, where would-be music-makers walk away from the instrument blaming themselves for not having enough musical talent or physical dexterity, when in fact the real culprit all along was the guitar. The Playing Experience Academy Series guitars, like this Academy 10 Dreadnought acoustic, was designed to offer enough immediate gratification to encourage a new player to keep playing. To do so, the playing experience was Taylor\u2019s priority: Easy to hold and play: the body is comfortable and lightweight. The guitar is easy to strum and fret. Rewarding sound: this guitar yields a good sound easily in the hands of a newer player. Not too precious. Durable. Minimal. A guitar that\u2019s too precious can be intimidating for a novice to play and care for. Broad appeal: it covers a broad range of music preferences.

The K-1 is engineered to incorporate all of the performance requirements of high resolution full frame 35mm digital photography, adding PENTAX unique performance features and characteristics. An improved noise processing algorithm provides unprecedented performance in shadows or low light shooting where high ISO settings are critical for good performance. With the highest ISO in it\u2019s class, the K-1 has achieved a staggering sensitivity range of up to ISO 204,800. This is attributable to a combination of the new large pixel, full frame sensor that has high noise resistance, and the new PRIME IV processor. Newly developed 5-axis SR II system covers the shake of yaw, pitch, roll, vertical, and horizontal motion of the camera. Shake reduction performance is improved to 5 shutter steps of compensation effect. Since SR is built-in to the K-1 body, it\u2019s operation works with every K-mount lens. Combining both the K-1\u2019s SR mechanism and the GPS feature, Astro Tracer easily tracks and photographs astronomical objects. By using movement of the image sensor during image exposure, the K-1 sensor generates the same level of moir\u00e9-reduction effect as optical AA (anti-aliasing) filter, without the softening effect. Unlike fixed optical AA filters, this allows the user to adjust the level of the moir\u00e9-reduction effect from OFF, Type1 and Type2. Bracketing of these settings is also available. For quick and easy operation in dark situations, the K-1 has new operation assist lighting placed in strategic locations on the body of the camera.

They have control circuitry inbuilt to regulate the output power over a wide range of dynamically changing input voltage levels and output impedance loads. They will also typically have fault condition sensing and circuitry to detect if the switcher is being overloaded or the input is under voltage. Some converters have in-built power factor correction circuits to improve the power factor presented to the mains supply. This reduces the burden on the mains supply, increases the efficiency of the switch-mode and reduces the noise created by the mains supply. All switches generate a high-frequency square wave output that needs to be filtered by a reactive element that stores and smoothens out the square wave ripple to produce a DC output.

The area imager enables the barcode reader to scan barcodes with elements as thin as 20 mils (20 thousandths of an inch) from up to 29.5\" away. Wireless Bluetooth capability allows the barcode reader to transmit data from up to 300\\' away from the charging base. The USB cable connects the charging base to a computer or host system (not included) to transmit barcode data. A TotalFreedom feature enables barcode formatting, parsing, and decoding software to be installed directly on the barcode reader instead of the host system. Honeywell Remote MasterMind software can be used by an administrator to manage the device remotely. A lithium-ion battery provides up to 14 hours of use and makes up to 50,000 scans on one charge. Up to seven Honeywell barcode readers can be paired with the charging base (additional barcode readers not included). The barcode reader weighs 13.4 oz. and measures 7.6 x 2.9 x 5.2 inches (H x W x D). (H is height, the vertical distance from the lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back.) The charging base weighs 10.2 oz. and measures 2.6 x 4.1 x 9.9 inches. It can withstand 50 drops of up to 6.5\\' onto a concrete floor. This barcode scanner has an Ingress Protection rating of IP65 for protection against dust and washing with water.Barcode scanners, also known as barcode readers, can be used to scan and decode barcodes and to transmit barcode data to a computer or another host system. Barcode readers with a single-line laser can be used to scan linear, one-dimensional (1D) barcodes. Some lasers can produce light in an omnidirectional pattern to allow scanning of barcodes from different angles. Other barcode readers contain CCD (charge-coupled device) light sensors instead of a laser for accuracy and wear resistance. Barcode scanners with raster scanning, area imaging, and other scanning technologies can allow scanning of two-dimensional (2D) or Portable Document Format 417 (PDF417) barcodes, among other types. Some barcode readers provide onboard flash memory to allow the storage of barcode data before transmitting it to a computer or host system through a USB cable or wireless WLAN or Bluetooth connection. Many barcode readers have a handle for handheld use and come with a stand or a charging cradle for fixed position applications, while others are designed for stationary use on a counter or another flat surface. Some portable readers are small enough to be carried in a pocket or attached to a lanyard.

The genesis of this model involved the need to strengthen self-propelled artillery at the end of the war. The newly constructed D10 - 100 mm cannon was mounted on the slightly modified hull of the popular SU-85. In the period 1944-46, about 4,500 units of this vehicle were produced. The SPG was very popular, serving in dozens of armies around the world. Several countries still keep the SU-100 on standby. The SU-100 SPG model is entirely designed with COBI building blocks. The inclusion of many awesome pad prints has enabled the vehicle to be faithfully reproduced. The set does not contain stickers at all, only prints! And the prints do not scratch or smear even during heavy use. The model is equipped with efficient crawler traction, a movable gun and openable hatch. Under the service flap there is a detailed motor. The set includes blocks with Soviet and Polish markings to choose from, another innovative and fun feature COBI brings to the set. The set is complemented by a figure of a soldier with a Mauser rifle, a cap and a red banner. The easy-to-read manual contains a list of blocks and statistics that you can use in the free COBI Historical Battle Game.

The microscope has an overall magnification range of 3.5x-90x. The 10MP camera has a CMOS color sensor, a reduction lens, image capture and editing software, and USB 2.0 output to capture or display still or video images on a computer or projector. The trinocular viewing head has an interpupillary range of 55 to 75mm, a 45-degree inclination to reduce eye and neck strain, and 360-degree rotation to enable sharing. The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port.

A Barlow lens with a magnification of less than 1.0 reduces magnification and increases the working distance, while a Barlow lens with a magnification greater than 1.0 increases the magnification and reduces the working distance. High-eyepoint eyepieces ease viewing for users who wear glasses, and dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences.

Air curtain is a powerful fan that forcing a high speed air stream over the entrance to isolate the interior and exterior air environment. It consumes less energy than an air conditioner. Air curtains are widely installed at the entrances of supermarket, theater, hotel, food storage warehouse, residential, etc. It keeps the conditioned air inside, reduces energy costs.The magnetic switch can be simply sticked to the middle of door and door frame, no bracket needed. Works easily with most doors and windows. Automatically turn on the air curtain with door open; shut off the air curtain with door close. High speed powerful air blow is for regular 7 to 8 feet office, restaurant or residential door entrance entrance, Low speed is for quiet area entrance or drive-thru window. This air curtain is quieter than the super power FM15 series because it generates 30% to 50% less air flow. The sound is from the high speed air circulation as same as a powerful home fan at the highest speed. Why magnetic switch is better than micro switch? The traditional mechanical plunger micro switch has to be installed accurately for the door panel or bracket push the rod on the switch, it has wear and tear issue for long time use. The 110VAC high voltage directly applies on the micro switch will cause sparks inside the micro switch which lower the life of usage too. The magnetic switch is much easier for installation, no restriction on the types of the door or windows. 12VDC low voltage on the magnetic switch connection is much safer.

The vertical trinocular port can be used as a C-Mount or 23mm photo port (camera sold separately). The WH10x20mm super-widefield high-eyepoint eyepieces combine with the 0.7x-4.5x zoom objective to provide continuous zoom magnification and a longer working distance for inspecting large-scale specimens that require handling or repair. High-eyepoint eyepieces ease viewing for users who wear glasses, and dioptric adjustment accommodates individual eye-strength differences. A stereo microscope, sometimes called an inspection or dissection microscope, has low magnification and a long working distance that enables users to manipulate the object being inspected.', 'Ambient lighting illuminates the specimen, eliminating the need for power or batteries. The microscope has a double-arm boom stand that enables users to position the microscope head on all three axes (X, Y, and Z). Bilateral focus eases use for left- and right-handed users. The stand has 20\" double arms, and a 30\" overall length. The pillar is 17\" and the focus rack has a 3\" diameter. The solid cast-steel base is 2 x 8-1/4 x 10-1/4 inches (H x W x D, where H is height, the vertical distance from the lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back).', 'Specifications', 'HeadTrinocularMagnification range7x-45xZoom objective power0.7x-4.5xEyepieces (DIN, 30mm)WH10x20mm high-eyepointTrinocular portC-Mount or 23mmField of view1-1/4\"Optical working distanceUp to 4\"Microscope standDouble-arm boom standHead movementX-, Y-, and Z-axesIllumination typeN/ALight sourceAmbientPowerN/A', 'Microscopes are instruments used to enhance the resolution of an object or image.

Stereo microscopes show object depth in a three-dimensional image. Digital microscopes are used to display an image on a monitor, rather than looking through a lens. Microscopes can have monocular (one), binocular (two), or trinocular (three) eyepieces, with varying magnification abilities. Magnification ability refers to the size of an image. Resolution, also known as resolvant power, refers to the clarity of the image. The interaction between field of view (FOV), numerical aperture (NA), and working distance (WD) determines resolution.

The continuous pursuit of performance and evolution has led to the creation of a completely-new \u2018MINI-Z 4x4\u2019 design that delivers an all-new driving experience for RC fans of all stripes, with superior overall design, driving performance and high-quality injection-molded scale body construction. A significant feature of the MINI-Z 4x4 series is the greater emphasis of body detail and quality of finish that even surpasses existing benchmarks set by the MINI-Z. The body is also molded with thicker material to better resist crash damage from operation in rough terrain. Incorporating the same ladder- style frame of real 4WD vehicles, the MINI-Z 4x4 boasts a 3-link rigid axle suspension combining what would normally be two upper links into a single upper A-arm to deliver maximum suspension movement. A specially designed high-torque steering servo enables this machine to throw its elbows around in the hard terrain for excellent performance in the toughest rock-crawler conditions. The high-torque 130-size motor brings out the beast in the MINI-Z 4x4, specially geared to run well in the low to medium speed ranges common in crawling.

Unlike previous versions of the Garmin Vector, the Vector 3 features a sleek, pod-less design for improved cornering clearance as well as simpler installation. No technical expertise is required for installation - all you need to know how to do is install pedals on your crankset. And since the power sensors are embedded in the pedals, bike-to-bike transfer is also incredibly easy as you just need to remove the pedals and install them on another bike. Other new features include the addition of Bluetooth connectivity to go along with the ANT+ connectivity so you'll have more options than ever regarding a compatible cycling computer of fitness device for data transmission and viewing. And it goes without saying that the Vector 3 pairs seamlessly with Garmin devices and apps for full integration into the Garmin cycling ecosystem.</p> <p>Of course, the Garmin Vector 3 pedals continue to deliver reliable, accurate data on every training session. Unlike other power meters, the Vector 3 measures power at the pedal, where force is applied. With force sensors in each pedal you'll have the capacity to see right and left leg power independently. The Vector 3 provides data on total power, cadence, as well as advanced cycling dynamics to show how and where you're producing power and feature a battery life of up to 120 hours. The pedals themselves are lightweight at just 316 grams/pair and utilize tried and true LOOK Ko compatible cleats.</p>\"] ['Communicate with Garmin Connect Mobile via Bluetooth for data syncing and software updates', 'Measure balance, cadence and advanced cycling dynamics to show how and where user is producing power', 'Sleek, podless design for improved cornering clearance and stack height for smarter ergonomics', 'Integrates with Garmin cycling ecosystem to allow easy updates via Garmin watches, Edge computers or phones', 'Installs like any other pedal for easy transfers between bikes'] {\"Brand\": \"Garmin\", \"Color\": \"Black\", \"Age Range (Description)\": \"Adult\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"13.39 x 6.3 x 2.36 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"0.3 Kilograms\", \"Style\": \"Sleek\", \"Item Package Dimensions L x W x H\": \"8.62 x 6.14 x 3.5 inches\", \"Package Weight\": \"0.65 Kilograms\", \"Brand Name\": \"Garmin\", \"Suggested Users\": \"unisex-adult\", \"Number of Items\": \"1\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Garmin\", \"Model Year\": \"2018\", \"Date First Available\": \"December 16, 2017\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}
