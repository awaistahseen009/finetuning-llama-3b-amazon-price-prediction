Unlike a typical direct box that merely transfers the sound of the pedals to the PA, the Direct-Drive simulates the tone and feel of a real guitar amp, producing a much more realistic sound. In other words, with the Direct-Drive on your pedalboard, you can do a gig without carrying an amp to the club. The design begins with a traditional 1/4\" guitar input and passive thru-put to feed a stage amp. This is then followed by a dedicated tuner output that is buffered in order to eliminate loading on the pickup or noise from the quartz clock. The guitar signal is then passed through a series of carefully sculpted filters to create Radials signature JDX tone. This is modelled after the sound of a SM57 in front of a Marshall 4x12 cabinet. The Direct-Drive goes further with two more voicing settings: the first adds a vintage Marshall tube head character to the signal path while the second delivers a tone reminiscent of an early Fender Twin. The two amp tones can be further tailored using a presence switch for extra sparkle. The guitar signal exits the Direct-Drive via either a 1/4\" guitar-level output or via a balanced XLR to feed the PA. The direct box output is outfitted with a 180 polarity reverse switch to help phase-align monitors with the stage amp along with a ground lift switch to help eliminate hum and buzz caused by ground loops. The Direct-Drive may be powered using a standard 9V power supply or typical pedalboard power brick.'] ['Guitar amp simulator for pedalboards', 'Eliminates need to bring an amp to the gig', '4 x 12 half-stack & open back combo tones', 'Employs Radials popular JDX tone shaping'] {\"Item Weight\": \"3.2 Pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"6 x 7 x 10 inches\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"March 11, 2016\", \"Color Name\": \"Red\", \"Compatible Devices\": \"Guitar\", \"Connector Type\": \"6.35mm Jack, XLR\", \"Power Source\": \"Corded Electric\", \"Brand\": \"Radial\", \"Color\": \"Red\", \"Model Name\": \"JDX Direct Drive BUNDLE\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The pneumatic wheels measure 3-1/2 inches wide and 10 inches in diameter, provide better traction than polyurethane wheels, are shock-absorbent, and can be used on uneven surfaces. The swivel casters offer maneuverability, measure 1 inch wide and 4 inches in diameter, and are made of solid rubber, which can't go flat and is resistant to wear.

(H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back.) When used as a platform truck, it has a load capacity of 650 pounds and measures 41 x 20 x 49 inches (H x W x D). The hand dolly's nose plate measures 17-3/4 x 7-3/4 inches (W x D).

A load is placed on the platform and the truck is leaned back, balancing the weight over the wheels.

The Mishimoto transmission cooler also features unique fins within the tubes to add even more cooling surface area and make sure that all of the fluid is in contact with a cooling surface. This feature, combined with the 83% increase in fluid capacity, means that no matter how low the airflow is, your transmission will stay safe and cool.

Power sequencing allows A/V equipment to be powered up in stages, which gives equipment time to idle before the next stage of equipment is engaged. When powering down, the sequence order is reversed, which results in a soft landing for your expensive AV equipment. Power sequencing can also prevent breaker trips caused by power surges during power-on. This device provides two groups of three AC power outlets for low-powered devices and one group of two AC power outlets for high-powered devices. Each of these groups constitute a \"zone\", which is sequentially powered on when power is applied. The sequence is reversed when the sequencer is switched off.

The new NIGHT DRAGON GT extends this enjoyment, and offers up to 20% more mileage. To reach this target, Pirelli engineers revamped the tire structures and compound, while preserving the same profiles and tread pattern to maintain handling and water evacuation. Compound The new compound of NIGHT DRAGON GT features a \u2018Full Carbon Black\u2019 formulation that combines different types of thermo reactive polymers to combine high mileage and grip. From a chemical point of view, this is a challenging task given the different characteristics of these polymers, which is akin to combining oil with water! Thanks to Pirelli\u2019s unique patented mixing process, combining special resins and plastifying agents, our engineers achieved a compound breakthrough. The result is a compound with a high homogeneity level that warms up quickly thanks to the Carbon Black, as well as delivering grip, wet performance, and high mileage. Profile The NIGHT DRAGON GT has the same profile as the original Night Dragon. It features a wide single radius contour that ensures a progressive behavior when entering the bend and to support the bike at every lean angle. It also shapes the contact area correctly from straight to full lean, for a crown area to ensure maximum traction. Tread Pattern design The NIGHT DRAGON GT maintains the original Night Dragon tread pattern design to guarantee high performance and excellent water drainage and mileage needs of these riders. The NIGHT DRAGON tread design\u2019s strength is its optimization of the contact patch area, offering ideal contact between the bike and road in every possible riding condition to deliver the power to the ground.'] ['Where performance meets the road: A specific tire for high-performance Harley-Davidson motorcycles.'] {\"Brand\": \"Pirelli\", \"Seasons\": \"Year Round\", \"Load Capacity\": \"1019 Pounds\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"20.61 x 7.09 x 20.61 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"9.9 Kilograms\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Pirelli\", \"Model\": \"Pirelli \", \"Product Dimensions\": \"20.61 x 7.09 x 20.61 inches\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Exterior\": \"Painted\", \"Manufacturer Part Number\": \"\", \"OEM Part Number\": \"\", \"Date First Available\": \"September 21, 2016\", \"Rim Size 16 Inches\": \"\", \"\": \"Speed Rating H\", \"Load Index 81.00\": \"\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

High-speed steel (HSS) provides hardness for wear resistance, and the black oxide finish acts as a lubricant to reduce wear while promoting chip and coolant flow. The self-centering 118-degree split point penetrates material without a pilot hole. Commonly called Silver and Deming drill bits, these reduced shank drill bits have a standardized 1/2-Inches diameter shank. The shank has three flats for better tool grip than a standard round shank.The set comes in a gray epoxy-coated steel case with labeled compartments for identification and organization. Case measures 8-3/8 x 6-3/8 x 2-1/8 inches (H x W x D). (H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back.)Drill bits are cutting tools used to make holes in a range of materials using machines such as handheld portable drills, machining centers, and lathes. Drill bits come in a variety of lengths and types, the most common of which is the twist drill bit. The round, twisted shaft of the twist drill bit typically has two cutting edges and flutes. The helical twist of the flutes brings chips up and away from the cutting edges and allows for coolant to reach the cutting edges. Jobber length twist drill bits, the most common length of twist drill bit, offer a good compromise of length and reach to work with the widest range of materials and applications. Mechanic's length twist drill bits (also called maintenance length) are a little shorter than jobber length and less prone to deflection when drilling. Short length twist drill bits (also called stub or screw-machine length) are the shortest and stiffest twist drill bits, helping to reduce the chance of deflection or breakage when drilling. Reduced shank drill bits (also called Silver and Deming drill bits) have a shank that is smaller in diameter than its shaft, permitting drilling machines with either a 1/2-Inches or 3/4-Inches drill chuck to create large holes. Long length twist drill bits (also called taper length) are a little longer than jobber length, allowing for deeper holes and longer reach. Extra long twist drill bits (also called extension) are longer than long length twist drill bits for greater reach or for drilling deeper holes.Chicago-Latrobe manufactures drill bits and accessories, reamers, countersinks, and blanks. The company, founded in 1890 and headquartered in Clemson, SC, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 9001.What\u2019s in the Box? 8 drill bits, inch sizes 9/16-Inches through 1-Inches in 1/16-Inches increments Steel case\"] ['Set of 8 reduced shank drill bits includes inch sizes 9/16\" through 1\" in 1/16\" increments', 'High-speed steel (HSS) provides hardness for wear resistance', 'Black oxide finish reduces bit wear while promoting chip and coolant flow on ferrous material', 'Self-centering 118-degree split point penetrates material without a pilot hole', 'Round shank with flats has three flat sides for better tool grip than a standard round shank', 'Made in the USA'] {\"Material\": \"High Speed Steel\", \"Finish Type\": \"Black Oxide\", \"Shank Type\": \"Round\", \"Cutting Angle String\": \"118 Degrees\", \"Brand\": \"Chicago Latrobe\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"6.2 x 2 x 8 inches; 6 Pounds\", \"Date First Available\": \"January 12, 2011\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Greenfield Industries\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Our customers report cleaner pipes and faucets, lower costs for descaling and heating, and better overall water quality. Depending on the current condition of your plumbing and how large existing limescale deposits are, it may take up to three months to observe a significant improvement.', 'EASY, CLEAN : All you need is access to a minimum of 10\" of free pipe space with a maximum pipe diameter of 2\". Yarna water descaling system is completely DIY with no need for any tools or specialized help. Installation is simple, takes only 15 minutes and is 100% maintenance free. Our whole house water descaler works with any type of piping up to 2\" thick including iron, copper, stainless steel, plastic, PVC, PE-x, and compound pipes.', \"WHY IS BETTER THAN : The Yarna CWD24 Water Descaler System won't eliminate wanted minerals from the water that are good for our bodies. The patented system allows the hardness level of water to remain unchanged before and after treatment, which mitigates the negative effects such as preventing minerals from forming scale deposits, which is the main disadvantage of hard water. Unlike traditional water softeners, Yarna does not require the use of salt or any water to be wasted.\", \"RISK-FREE 365 DAYS, 100% MONEY BACK GUARANTEE: You will enjoy a limescale-free environment as long as our Yarna house water softener descaling system is installed.

Lighting is often described as Jewelry for a room, and this gorgeous piece will enhance any d\u00e9cor silhouette to it maximum potential. Hand Cut Clear Crystal is the choice of traditionalists. The hand cut crystal is cut by hand in two stages on an iron wheel and then on a sandstone wheel. Each crystal is then polished on a wood wheel with marble dust. These methods go back centuries. If you look closely, you will notice faint traces of the wood-wheel attesting to the concentrated labor of the artisan. This is a mark of authenticity, marking each piece a unique and original masterpiece. The 523-SA is 8.5IN in diameter x 13.75IN tall. The 523-SA comes one per package, and requires one (1) 100W medium base incandescent lamp (not included), dimmable using a standard incandescent dimmer.

Crystorama has focused their efforts by taking their vast design experience and fusing it with current inspirations to produce fashion forward styles.

Over the past four-plus decades there\u2019s a resounding theme from Taylor Guitars: passion for improving the guitar-playing experience. As a company that\u2019s passionate about exposing more players to the pleasures of making music, Taylor isn\u2019t content to see people throw in the towel before they have a chance to get their groove on. The Academy Series, which includes this Academy 12 Grand Concert Acoustic, represents Taylor\u2019s effort to support the development of the entry-level guitar player.

So the approach tends to be: start with an inexpensive, \u201cgood-enough\u201d guitar, and if things progress, upgrade to something better. But all too often this ends in hand-wringing frustration, where would-be music-makers walk away from the instrument blaming themselves for not having enough musical talent or physical dexterity, when, in fact, the real culprit all along was the guitar. The Playing Experience The Academy Series, which includes this Academy 12 Grand Concert, was designed to offer enough immediate gratification to encourage a new player to keep playing. To do so, the playing experience was Taylor\u2019s priority: ? Easy to hold and play: The body is comfortable and lightweight, and easy to strum and fret ? Rewarding sound: Yields a good sound easily in the hands of a newer player ? Not too precious: Durable, minimal, so it's not intimidating for a novice\\xa0to play and care for ?
